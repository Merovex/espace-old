These pilots don't depend on capacitor power as much as other races do, but it's still very important, especially for active tanks, for running propulsion modules and for capacitor warfare.

Capacitor is life – without energy in your capacitor, you can’t run active modules, your defenses degrade, and you end up stripped of your ship, floating in space in a pod. Amarr pilots depend on capacitor energy to run active armor tanks and to fire lasers, and as a result, they must develop several capacitor management skills.
