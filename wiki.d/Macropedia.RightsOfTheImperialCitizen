text=%3c%3c|ImperiumEditionIndex|>>%0a%0aWhile providing a guideline for the interaction of the Imperium government and its citizens, the first attempt at codifying that relationship did little more than provide a cornerstone upon which later rights were added. The general progress of Imperial political and social life lead to increasingly more rights being ascribed to its citizens. However, this first attempt had several severe limitations that were later adjusted in court or by popular assent.%0a%0a!!! Notable Limitations:%0a* Rights only apply to "free citizens" not to prisoners, or in some cases debtors.%0a* Little or no redress for violations by the Imperial Government.%0a* Description of rights were complex and not easily explained.%0a* Didn't properly address the subcultures participating the in Imperium. ([[Imudring]] & [[Heljyks]])%0a%0a!!! Rights as Generally Defined%0a* Right of Fair Commerce: permitted free citizens broad discretion in the commercial activities. However, most private citizens had little chance to enjoy this right because it also guaranteed payments of debt and enforcement of such. Since most citizens were in debt to one or another of the [[FullyIntegratedCorporation|FICs]], it is generally seen to have guaranteed the effective slavery of most Imperium Citizens. Also established Imperial measures.%0a* Right of Free Space: permitted free citizens travel privileges within the Imperium itself. Of course, it made no guarantee for the government to provide such transportation. However, if you had the means, the Imperium would not restrict your movements (with some military exceptions). The Imperium did retain the right to restrict travel for safety reasons.%0a* Right of Religious Practice: Free citizens were permitted to practice approved religions to the extent their means would allow. %0a* Right of Establishment: Allowed colonists and their descendents on many worlds establish ownership of local resources from before the Imperium. It is unclear whether this was a misstep by the ImperialCongress, or whether they somehow intended this to prevent the ImperialCoreWorlds from practicing some form of colonial poaching. This is perhaps the technically complicated right both in wording and execution.%0a* Right of Custom: Permitted local customs, cultures, and authorities to develop. Also enforced the subjugation of such governments to the Imperial Throne. Also, established the official "Imperial" culture for the conduct of all Imperium-level business, utilizing the HagurinCharacterSet and other standards.%0a* Right of Citizenship: Allows any human to claim the Rights of the Imperial Citizen. Alternatively, it pronounces the Imperium's official claim to rule all of humanity. Which interpretation is relevent varies historically.%0a%0a!!
