text=!!!-1,000,000C: Ancient Galactic Civilization%0aWhile early hominids were still mastering stone tools, an alien race arose in another part of the galaxy. Their civilization flourished for perhaps 100,000 years before the decline set in, and their empire faded away. This ancient empire did leave relics and ruins on a number of worlds, enough to determine that they were in possession, at least at the height of their power, of some form of FTL technology.%0a%0a!!!21C-23C: Emergence%0a%0aDuring this period, the post-modern era (early 21C) descends into a dystopian Cyberpunk era as the global population begins to exceed resources/logistics. A handful of corporations gain international control of space. The Corporations are successful in exploring the solar system. They build mining colonies on Luna, the asteroid belt, and beyond. They colonize Mars with domes and begin an Iceteroid atmosphere project to make the surface livable at some point in the future. Ships travel primarily by rocket and ramscoop, with some using solar sails or laser propulsion. Interplanetary communications are through lasers and radio with occasional messenger boats. The era ends with the destruction of the corporations during a revolt by the colonies.%0a%0a''the Emergence Era has been voted on the list and under EmergenceEra''%0a        %0a!!!24C-26C: First Expanse%0a%0aDuring the First Expanse, humanity expands from the home system of Sol. Much of the colonization effort is handled by huge slowboat generation ships or sleeper ships. These ships were slung from Earth using huge lasers to push their solar sails. Some were aided by Ramscoops. Taking years to reach even the nearest stars, these ships had just begun the colonization process when String Theory finally panned out to yield faster-than-light travel. Small FTL ships started flitting out to, from, and among the colonies.%0a%0aAfter the "Belter Revolt" that ended the EmergenceEra, Earth's government is dominated by Belters as an ever-tightening Socialist regime. The Coporations didn't take very long before they began exerting their influences again, although not as strongly as before. Countries, as we know them in the 20th century, cease to exist. Earth is united under the UN-Belter government.%0a%0aThe Colonists discovered that ecosystems with large, complex organisms were fairly common. This provided a rich bed for trade, science, and disaster. Only about 100 years after the introduction of FTL travel, stories began to return by the old message-lasers and recorded in the memories of the message boats. The stories told of surreal horrors that befell hyperdrive ships re-entering realspace. Navigational errors that doomed the crews to starvation or suffocation became more common, and severe. Ships "phased in" incorrectly, leading to horrid ghost-existences. To make it worse, these problems appeared first and developed more quickly along the most popular routes. Soon, hyperspace travel was a task for fools, and the interstellar community collapsed. %0a%0a[[Chronology.FirstExpanse |More]] on First Expanse%0a        %0a!!27C-37C: First Decline%0a%0aFollowing the collapse of the interstellar community. The colonies adapt as best they can. Earth reels from the impact of alien plaques. '''This is still under discussion on-list.'''%0a%0a[[Chronology/FirstDecline|More]] on First Decline%0a%0a!!38C-43C: Imperial Dominion%0a%0aAn oligarchy forms among several prosperous colonies, who steadily begin adding other colonies. Eventually, a few powerful families control this oligarchy and from this caste, an Imperitor is founded. Most major colonies are reabsorbed, though many smaller, or difficult to reach colonies remain independent and forgotten. Rise of the Mecha Clans.%0a%0aThis period is more clearly discussed in the [[Macropedia/ImperiumEdition|Macropedia Terradoma: Imperium Edition]] and the [[Macropedia/ImperiumMacropediaTimeline|Imperial timeline]].%0a         %0a!!44C-56C: Second Decline%0a%0aInfighting among the oligarchy is inevitable, and fights are settled in Mecha combat. Here be Mechwarriors.%0a%0a[[Chronology.SecondDecline |More]] on the Second Decline%0a        %0a!!57C-59C:  Reunification%0a%0aDon't know why, but the mecha wars are resolved, and a more civil Republic is born.%0a%0a[[Chronology.Reunification |More]] on the Reunification%0a%0a!!60C-62C: First Contact%0a%0aWhich, is a good thing, because we start expanding again and end up meeting up with another race. Perhaps here would be a good time to introduce radically different FTL technology. Perhaps we have one main technology branch before, and this leads to a second. Both sides are able to overcome their natural xenophobic tendencies and get along rather well for a while. %0a%0a[[Chronology.FirstContact |More]] on First Contact%0a        %0a!!63C-69C: Hegemony%0a%0aHowever, this is not necessarily a good thing, because the other race was holding back on us. We eventually start meeting other races, warp technology freeing up the earlier jump limitations. But, humans were sort of behind the power curve and aren't the kings of the hill.%0a%0a[[Chronology.Hegemony |More]] on the Hegemony%0a%0a!!70C-77C: Third Decline - Xenodominion%0a%0aAnd, if you're not at the top, sooner or later you'll be under somebody's boot. Perhaps race in First Contact was  looking for a good excuse to play master to our slave. Either way, humans are subjected en masse.%0a%0a[[Chronology.Xenodominion |More]] on Xenodominion%0a        %0a!!78C- : Federation%0a%0aFortunately, we are resilient, free-spirited, and the other race became a tad too complacent. We throw off our shackles and assert our equal role among the other races. This takes a while since having been dominated, it takes a while for everybody else to accept that we are a serious force to be accepted.%0a%0a[[Chronology.Federation |More]] on the Federation%0a(:title The E-Space Time Line:)
