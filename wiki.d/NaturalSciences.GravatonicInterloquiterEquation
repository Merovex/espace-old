text=The Scholar [[Macropedia/Kemen Febrer Suwor]] developed the Gravatonic Interloquiter Equation (GIE, pronounced "guy") during the [[Chronology/First Expanse]]. The theory behind GIE essentially stated that risk of hop failure increased geometrically as one approched a gravity body. Just as it was coincidence that 37 degrees Celcius is the average temperature of the human body, it was discovered that being 1 AU from Sol was the point where the geometric increase far outstripped the advantage of jumping. Arbitrarily, that point was labelled GIE 10--point of abject failure. The scale was also marked at the point outside the solar wind, GIE 1. During the previous expanse, the average trans-system ship could safely jump up to GIE 9. This is based in part on stellar magnitude. Thus, if the stellar magnitude of a star is 2.4, GIE 10 will likely be found at 2.4 AU. Likewise, GIE 1 is found at 94 AU from Sol--the extent of the solar wind. So, with a stellar magnitude of 2.4, the distance will be 225.6 AU.%0a%0aHere is a rough chart of the various GIE factors.%0a* GIE 10 = 1 AU%0a* GIE 9  = 4 AU%0a* GIE 8  = 9 AU%0a* GIE 7  = 16 AU%0a* GIE 6  = 25 AU%0a* GIE 5  = 36 AU%0a* GIE 4  = 49 AU%0a* GIE 3  = 64 AU%0a* GIE 2  = 81 AU%0a* GIE 1  = 94 AU%0a%0aDuring the early period of the Terran Decline, there was a massive change in the safe level for hops.
