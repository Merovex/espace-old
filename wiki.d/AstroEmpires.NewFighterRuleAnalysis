text=Introduction%0a============%0a%0a`AstroEmpires recently %0a[[http://forum.astroempires.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=70020| changed the Fighter Rules]] %0aagainst units it would normally be shield-raped by---in the interests of%0afairness. As this article points out, the real affect is to empower%0aestablished players over newer players, and to try to imbalance the%0atenants of the [[Small Fleet Doctrine]], which in reality remain%0aeffective. Odd that ``fairness" advantages the elite. My analysis shows%0athat the actual impact is misstated because of weak examples.%0a%0aThis rule only applies to Fighters against shield-raping units. This%0abenefits advanced players who have [[SmallFleetDoctrine|capital units]].%0aThis is a misguided effort to make capital ships matter.%0a%0a(:*toc:)%0a%0aRant%0a=========%0a%0aMy complaint is secondarily against the shoddy explanation on their%0apart. They use worst-case examples rather than real-life. They imply%0aabilities that were meant to be game-balancing. They zeroize technology,%0aagain ignoring real-life differentials. Finally, one example mixes the%0afact, hiding the real ratio impact.%0a%0aWith planetary rings, they show the ``worst case" example of a%0aplanet, not the ``average case" of moons. The actual average actual%0aaverage of the three types is 29,167(:footnote 50,000 + 25,000 + 12,500 / 3:) %0awhen looking at the raw costs. However, there are fewer planets%0athan moons as a truism. Seasoned players favor moons and asteroids over%0aplanets because of this lower cost. Bases will tend to be on moons and%0aasteroids. Therefore, their hypothetical ''overstates'' actual gameplay %0aby at-least double.%0a%0aAssuming moons are the average, AE would only allow 25,000 FTs to attack%0aprings. This reduces the damage per wave to 1100 points,(:footnote 25000 FT/ * 0.044:)%0afrom 10,752(:footnote The armour of Pring-1 at Armour-22 is 10,260:). This%0aseverely reduces the efficiency of Fighters, significantly increasing the cost of%0aconquest with Fighters. However, the real impact is against pshields,%0awhere the impact is much more severe. The table below shows the%0acost-ratio, which helps show the impact.%0a%0aThe abstract example further conceals the practical. If a capital can%0acarry, say 1000 FTs in the case of a Titan, then that affects the combat%0aratio. In real life, an naval aircraft carrier or battleship has escorts%0aand fighter coverage. So, too, in `AstroEmpires are there escort units%0aand Fighters.%0a%0aThey describe the ``Fighter shield-crossing ability," which is not an%0aability at all. It was an effort to give Fighters a chance, an effort%0awith the unforeseen advantage in massive amounts. Other units have a%0asimilar ability. One could construe this phrase to suggest a special%0aability.%0a%0aThey baselined the examples with zeroized technology. Any player who has%0aplayed for 2 months should have Armour of at least 22. Capital units%0arequire higher armour tech, tilting the real values in favor of the%0acapitals by as much as 15 percent in the case of a Death Star. It also%0aignores the impact of derb harvesting afterward.%0a%0aThe example of the Fighters attacking the Battleship shows, at least,%0asloppy reasoning. In the original example, only Fighters are attacking.%0aIn the second example, Bombers are added, trebbling the attacker's%0aratio. The real loss to the defender would have been only 6,875 credits.%0aThe attacker's losses is uniform in either case at 4,200.  So, the%0a''real'' ratio is 1.63:1; the example had 3.17:1. This error is double%0athe example. The example shows a one-third reduction in the ratio. The real%0areduction is two-thirds.%0a%0aSo, we see in the examples the misstated impact by at-least double is%0auniform. This seems to suggest an awareness of the true impact, and an%0aeffort to minimize reaction to that impact.%0a%0aShields are useless against massive attacking units, that is what AE %0aadmitted. Just throw a few mio FTs and all opponents are toast. This is%0aa ploy I have seen used since I started playing in Summer 2007. This is nothing%0anew, just something they decided to change. But, AE is basically%0asaying the cost ratio of a unit's armour is the fundamental determinant.%0aThat allows us to put some real analysis into the impact on the game.%0a%0aAnalysis%0a========%0a%0aTo distill their analysis, divide your unit's armour by its cost (or cost,%0aby armour). Let's look at a the cost-ratio of units.%0a%0a(:table class='structure' style='width: 50%25':)%0a(:cellnr class='heading':)Unit%0a(:cell class='heading':)Cost Ratio%0a(:cell class='heading':)New Cost Ratio%0a(:cellnr class='highlight':)FT%0a(:cell class='highlight':)0.88 (4.4 / 5)%0a(:cell class='highlight':)0.29(:footnote Ratio applies only against shield-raping units.:)%0a(:cellnr class='even highlight':)BO%0a(:cell colspan='2' class='even highlight':)0.44 (4.4 / 10)%0a(:cellnr:)HB%0a(:cell colspan='2':)0.29 (8.8 / 30)%0a(:cellnr class='even':)IB%0a(:cell colspan='2' class='even':)0.14%0a(:cellnr class='highlight':)CV%0a(:cell colspan='2' class='highlight':)0.44 %0a(:cellnr class='even highlight':)DD%0a(:cell colspan='2' class='even highlight':)0.44%0a(:cellnr:)FR%0a(:cell colspan='2':)0.33%0a(:cellnr class='even':)IF%0a(:cell colspan='2' class='even':)0.22%0a(:cellnr:)SS%0a(:cell colspan='2':)0.11%0a(:cellnr class='even':)OS%0a(:cell colspan='2' class='even':)0.09%0a(:cellnr class='highlight':)CR%0a(:cell colspan='2' class='highlight':)0.26%0a(:cellnr class='even':)CA%0a(:cell colspan='2' class='even':)0.13%0a(:cellnr:)HC%0a(:cell colspan='2':)0.21%0a(:cellnr class='even':)BB%0a(:cell colspan='2' class='even':)0.14%0a(:cellnr:)FC%0a(:cell colspan='2':)0.03%0a(:cellnr:)DR%0a(:cell colspan='2':)0.11%0a(:cellnr class='even highlight':)Pring%0a(:cell colspan='2' class='even highlight':)0.43%0a(:cellnr class='highlight':)Pshield%0a(:cell colspan='2' class='highlight':)1.72%0a(:tableend:)%0a%0aUsing the table above, if you want to kill a shielded unit, just make%0asure you use a lot of shield-raped unshielded that have a lower%0acost-ratio.

They take a synthetic situation and%0a%3c "fairize" the rules. The fact that these rules have been in place since%0a%3c the birth of Alpha... They had to know of this imbalance. Heck, I've%0a%3c been showcasing it for months; and I'm not all that smart.%0a%3c %0a%3c In terms of prings, they show the ``worst case" example of a planet, not%0a%3c the ``average case" of moons (actual average of the three types is%0a%3c 29.167, but there are many more moons and roids than planets).%0a%3c %0a%3c Shields are useless against massive attacking units, that's what they're%0a%3c admitting. Just throw a few mio FTs and all opponents are toast. This is%0a%3c a ploy I've seen used for nearly 2 years. This is nothing new, just%0a%3c something they decided to change. But, they're basically saying the cost%0a%3c ratio of a unit's armour is the fundamental determinant.%0a%3c %0a%3c To distill their analysis, divide your FT's armour by its cost (or cost,%0a%3c by armour). Let's look at a the cost-ratio of units.%0a%3c %0a%3c (:table class='structures':)%0a%3c (:cellnr:)FT%0a%3c (:cell:)0.88 (4.4 / 5)%0a%3c (:cellnr:)BO%0a%3c (:cell:)0.44 (4.4 / 10)%0a%3c (:cellnr:)HB%0a%3c (:cell:)0.29 (8.8 / 30)%0a%3c (:cellnr:)IB%0a%3c (:cell:)0.14%0a%3c (:cellnr:)CV%0a%3c (:cell:)0.44 %0a%3c (:cellnr:)DD%0a%3c (:cell:)0.44%0a%3c (:cellnr:)FR%0a%3c (:cell:)0.33%0a%3c (:cellnr:)IF%0a%3c (:cell:)0.22%0a%3c (:cellnr:)SS%0a%3c (:cell:)0.11%0a%3c (:cellnr:)OS%0a%3c (:cell:)0.09%0a%3c %0a%3c (:cellnr:)CR%0a%3c (:cell:)0.26%0a%3c (:cellnr:)CA%0a%3c (:cell:)0.13%0a%3c (:cellnr:)HC%0a%3c (:cell:)0.21%0a%3c (:cellnr:)BB%0a%3c (:cell:)0.14%0a%3c (:cellnr:)DR%0a%3c (:cell:)0.11%0a%3c (:tableend:)%0a%3c %0a%3c Using the examples above, you wanna kill a shielded unit, just make sure%0a%3c you use a lot of unshielded that have a lower cost-ratio.%0a%3c '''This puts Corvettes, Destroyers and Bombers into the%0a%3c ascendancy'''. I submit CVs and DDs are the true ascendant as they do not%0a%3c require support units for transportation.%0a%3c %0a%3c Looking at the FT v TI example they gave, the ratio ''was'' 5.88 : 1%0a%3c (reduced to 1.70 : 1). This reduces the FT's cost-ratio to 0.29 against%0a%3c %0a%3c (:comment This page has been edited using Pywe:)%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
