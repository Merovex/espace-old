text=(:title Base Defense Guide:)%0a>>span-6%3c%3c%0a(:*toc:)%0a%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0aThe '''Base Defense Guide''' describes suitable defenses premised on the%0abase's profile profile; how much an attacker can reasonably expect to get in pillaging the base. The goal is to provide a basic understanding of%0abase defense that enables a player to build defenses specific to his%0aneeds. Remember, any base defense may be taken by a motivated rival.%0aThe objective is to reduce the benefit the rival gains by taking the%0abase.%0a%0a>>alert-message block-message info%3c%3c%0a``Fixed fortifications are a monument to the stupidity of man." --- Geo.%0aS. Patton%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0aWhile Patton's famous saying is valid, in Astro Empires the only thing%0amore foolhardy than fixed fortifications is no fixed fortification.%0aAstro Empires is an economic, military, political simulation. To ignore%0aany of these aspects is to jeopardize one's enjoyment of the game.  This%0aguide discusses the defensive structures and offers a structure for when%0ato have what mode of base defense.%0a%0aMotivation%0a==========%0a%0aAs with the [[Small Fleet Doctrine]], this guide is about efficiencies.%0aYou are trying to raise the efficiency of your defenses to reduce the%0aefficiency of your rivals. If he is going to take your base, you need%0ato ensure he does not profit in the exchange. Generally, wise rivals%0aonly attack bases that are likely to turn a profit. The question becomes%0awhat is profit? Defenses generally deter those who are after momentary%0afinancial gain. Some rivals have other motives: power, shame, control and%0athe strategic goal of suppressing an opponent in war are other%0areasons why a rival might hit your base. To defend against these%0amotives, a player's only real defense is a strong mobile fleet that he%0aclosely shepherds. That mobile fleet is the purpose of the [[Small Fleet Doctrine]].%0a%0aThere are essentially three things your base defenses protect. The%0aobvious first benefactor is the base itself: its economy and%0aproductivity. The second benefactor is that base's trade. The other%0abenefactor is the fleet in orbit over that base.%0a%0aStrategy%0a========%0a%0aThe power of a base's combined defenses and fleets should exceed the%0atotal economic value of the base, fleet debris and trade routes. The%0adefenses protect the base and the fleet protects itself and the trade%0aroutes. How do you calculate the base's economic value?%0a%0a* The value of the fleet debris is twice the percentage of the player's Armour technology. Therefore, Armour-12 provides 24 percent that fleet's value of debris.%0a* The trade routes are a simple addition of the value of the route viewed in your base's Trade tab.%0a%0aThe economic value of the base is a little more fluid. The value is:%0a%0a>>alert-message block-message info%3c%3c%0aValue = (Empire Econ / Base Econ) * Credits on Hand + Pillage Bonus%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0aThat is, divide the total imperial economy by that base's economy; this%0ais a percentage of its contribution to the economy. This provides a%0apercentage share of the credits you have available to %0aspend.(:footnote For this reason, you should always squirrel away extra income in long-term technology or construction that you can cancel when you need the credits.:)%0aTo this, you add the pillage bonus. The table below shows the rough%0abonus provided derived from that base's economy. I would argue that the%0abonus is what pillagers can rely on, so discount the cash-on-hand%0abenefit by keeping those credits banked or spent.%0a%0aTo protect the trade routes, you need an efficient fleet (a balance of%0aFighters and Cruisers) overhead. To keep it simple, let us assume that%0athe fleet's responsibility is to defend itself and the trade routes, and%0athe base defenses are responsible for defending the base. When you get%0ato Planetary Rings, you will learn this model starts to flake as the%0adefenses are strong enough to assist in protecting the value of the%0atrade routes.%0a%0a(:bburl #pillagebonus:)%0a{| cellspacing=0 class='structure'%0a|-%0a!Base Econ%0a!Pillage Bonus%0a!Base Econ%0a!Pillage Bonus%0a|-%0a|10%0a|54%0a|110%0a|6534%0a|-%0a|20%0a|216%0a|120%0a|7776%0a|-%0a|30%0a|486%0a|130%0a|9126%0a|-%0a|40%0a|864%0a|140%0a|10584%0a|-%0a|50%0a|1350%0a|150%0a|12150%0a|-%0a|60%0a|1944%0a|160%0a|13824%0a|-%0a|70%0a|2646%0a|170%0a|15606%0a|-%0a|80%0a|3456%0a|180%0a|17496%0a|-%0a|90%0a|4374%0a|190%0a|19494%0a|-%0a|100%0a|5400%0a|200%0a|21600%0a|}%0a%0aExample%0a-------%0a%0aAssume you have 7000 credits on hand, your total economy is 1000 and your base's economy is 100. The percentage share is 10 percent (1000/100), or 700. The pillage bonus is 5400. Therefore, the rival would obtain 6100 in pillaging that base.%0a%0aContinuing with the example above, if you have 10,000 credits in fleet%0aover the base and your Armour technology is at level 10, then that fleet%0awould provide 2,000 credits in salvage. Therefore, the base's fleet and%0apillage value is 8,100.%0a%0aIf your base has four trade routes each valued at, say, 2000, then the%0apiracy value is 8,000. Therefore, the economic gain to your rival%0ais 16,100.%0a%0aFinally, you have to deduce how much salvage he may obtain in recovering%0ahis own fleet. Assuming his fleet was evenly matched with yours (10,000)%0aand had the same Armour tech, then he would recover 2,000. This makes%0athe total economic value at 18,100. '''Your defenses must create more economic loss than 18,100 to make that base non-profitable.''' Based on%0athe rule of thumb above, your base defenses need to handle 9,000 credits of this%0avalue, with the overhead fleet able to handle the other 9,000 credits%0a(or more).%0a%0aLet us assume your fleet defenses are a split mix of Cruisers and%0aFighters (5,000 or 25 Cruisers and 5,000 or 1,000 Fighters). Assuming%0apower technology (Laser and Plasma) at 10, then the combined firepower%0aof this fleet is 39,000; but you have to be mindful of the weakness of%0aFighters against shielded units, which reduces the overall efficacy of%0athe fleet. In the face of Dreadnoughts, the Fighters and Cruisers are%0aeffectively %0aworthless.(:footnote The Cruisers would deliver 6 points of damage after passing through the shields, and the Dread has 768 armour points:)%0aWhat can we do to even the odds?%0a%0aFirst, the solution is not always more fleet. More fleet equals more%0adebris. So, the fleet becomes its own problem. This is why the base%0adefenses should be somewhat self-sustaining.%0a%0aDefenses%0a========%0a%0aThis section discusses the four categories of Base Defenses. For the%0apurpose of this article, Commanders are not considered.%0a%0aCommand Centers (CC)%0a--------------------%0a%0a>>alert-message block-message info%3c%3c%0aCommand Centers value lies in raising occupation. %0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0aBecause Command Centers raise the base-owner's overhead fleet's power,%0atheir value lies in the _offensive_. This means they provide limited%0avalue on the defensive, because a wise attacker will bring the fleet%0anecessary to take out the fleet's armour, thus limiting his fleet's%0aexposure to the higher power. %0a%0aThe only context, therefore, where Command Centers can be used in the%0aoffensive is in raising or harassing occupations. Specifically, Fighters%0acan deliver more punch to harvesting Recyclers.  Therefore, you should%0aalways have some Command Centers available in the event you need to%0araise or harass an occupation fleet.%0a%0aEach Command Center boosts your overall defensive power by five percent.%0aVeterans will build ten to fifteen CCs on a base to improve the power of%0athe defensive fleet up to 75 percent. Building ten is considered%0areasonable for a free player. A Heavy Cruiser with 10 CCs and medium%0aplasma research (10-15 levels) will dish out 125 points of damage.%0aCommand Centers protect the overhead fleet, which protects trade routes.%0a%0aIn the example above, the Cruisers delivered only 36 points, six after%0apassing through the shield. With 10 Command Centers, they would deliver%0a54 points, or 24 points. That is four times more effective damage.%0aFifteen Centers would allow 33 points to penetrate the shields. So,%0ainstead of needing 128 Cruisers (25,600cr) to defeat a rival%0aDreadnought, you need 35 (7,000) or 32 (6,400) respectively. This%0aimprovement makes the Cruisers viable against Dreadnaughts (but not%0aagainst Titans). So, do not underestimate the value of Command Centers.%0a%0aA wise attacker reduces his damage profile (how much he will lose) by%0asending the minimum quantity of fleet necessary to destroy the defense%0afleet. It does not matter if your fleet can deliver 50 percent more%0adamage if the attacker does not give you the extra fleet to kill. He%0aneeds the firepower to kill your defense fleet regardless of your%0aCommand Centers.%0a%0aTurrets%0a-----------------%0a%0a>>alert-message block-message info%3c%3c%0a'''Best of Three Rule of Thumb:''' With Turrets, build three of your best, disband the rest.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0aThis guide groups Turrets together. They do not benefit from Command%0aCenters. When you look at the destructive value of Turrets, you discover%0athey are weak. In the beginning of your empire (before Level 20)%0aUnshielded Turrets, Ion Turrets and Photon Turrets are of some utility.%0aThe rule of thumb is three of your best turrets, and always scrap the%0aweaker turrets. You need the space for other structures. Weaker turrets%0acan undermine the value of the higher turrets. You will notice, however,%0athat Turrets have limits.%0a%0aFor example, the Photon Turret delivers 480 points per structure, or%0a1,440 at the Three-Turret Rule. That is suitable for bases with a value%0aof 2,900. Based on the table above, this is a base with an Econ of 70 or%0aless; assuming the fleet can protect the trade %0aroutes.(:footnote The power of the Photon Turret here is inflated to Photon-10, as are all examples here:)%0a%0aBy contrast, Disruptor Turrets provide 4,032, which handles a base%0aeconomy of 86. Many Veteran players recommend that bases not exceed%0athat economy until you attain Planetary Rings. Keeping the economy under%0a100 is what I would recommend.%0a%0aUnshielded Turrets are useful only when the player is threatened%0aprimarily by Destroyers, Corvettes and Fighters. They are built in the%0aearly days of the Empire, then quickly upgraded to Photon and Disruptor.%0aIon Turrets have value in their shield penetrability, able to place 510%0apower against shielded units.%0a%0a%0aShields%0a---------%0a%0a>>alert-message block-message info%3c%3c%0aShields raise the ``price of admission" for an attacker, but not the%0a``price of conquest." Build shields to support planetary rings---only.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0aPlanetary Shields, and the lesser cousin the Deflection Shields, provide%0aa measure of protection for your turrets and Planetary Rings. Shields%0aregenerate the defenses (turrets and rings) when an attack does not%0adestroy them. The amount of regeneration is based on a percentage of the%0aremaining defensive strength. Fortunately, the battle report has two%0avalues that help with this calculation: ``Start Defenses" and ``End Defenses." To calculate regeneration, multiply the original defensive%0alevel by the End Defenses percentage (e.g. Defense * .65 for a End%0aDefenses of 65 percent). End Defenses are calculated based on the sum of%0aarmour present at the end of the battle divided by the sum of the%0afull-strength armor.%0a%0a%0aPlanetary Rings%0a---------------%0a%0aPlanetary Rings are the first true deterrent to capital ships. A bank of%0aPrings delivers 15,360 points of Photonic trouble to any%0aattacker.(:footnote Remember, the power and armor shown in the Tables page of AE is before you apply the bonus for technology. You need Photon-10, which raises the base Power by 50 percent:) %0a%0aFollowing the '''Best of Three Rule of Thumb''', you should seek to have three levels%0aof Planetary Rings, which delivers 15,360 points. Against a Death Star,%0ait would inflict 14,790 power. Three sets would deliver%0a44,370 power, able to take down a Death Star, three Levis, ten Titans,%0aor 85 Cruisers.(:footnote Cruisers are the most efficient unit against Planetary Rings:)%0aThe point is that a Planetary Ring is sufficient to defend a combined%0abase value of over 40,000 credits.%0a%0a``Pringles" is a term for a pair of Prings and Pshields. When you finish%0aa set of Pringles, then you can start downsizing your defensive fleet.%0aOr, more accurately, you can get those lazy bums into the attack. With%0aPringles-2, you can usually drop your defenses down to about 4000 FT and%0a2 BB.%0a%0a>>alert-message block-message info%3c%3c%0aI have information on the optimal defensive fleet configurations below, which supersedes the above reference to fighters and BBs.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0aTrade Pring Effect%0a------------------%0a%0aWhen efficiently defending a base, the first pring is actually dedicated to supporting the base defense fleet. Merovech calls this the Trade Pring Effect. When the base has long-distance trades and Dreads defending them, the value of the base, trades and derbs exceeds a single pring's ability to defend them. Therefore, you need to discount the first pring in your base defenses.%0a%0aPractical Example%0a-----------------%0a%0a>>alert-message block-message info%3c%3c%0aMerovech attained prings in the following timeframes:%0a* First pring in Epsilon + 69 in a E7 cluster galaxy.%0a* First pring in Fenix + 51 in a F1 cluster galaxy.%0a* First pring in Gamma + 49 in a G1 cluster galaxy.%0a* First pring in Helion + 46 in a H0 cluster galaxy.%0a* First pring in Ixion + 45 days in a I0 cluster galaxy.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0aHow does Merovech reach prings quickly? When in scenarios where there%0aare players more than ten levels above him, he rigidly adheres to the%0aprinciple of staying under Level 30. This limits This limits the%0a``overhead" threat of higher level players, but leaves him somewhat%0avulnerable. %0a%0aMerovech has managed to build prings without researching Disruptor (even%0ain a zero-cluster galaxy) or having Disruptor turrets by keeping with%0athe defense standards below.%0a%0aTo remain below Level-30 your combined economy (times 100), fleet and%0atechnology must be less than 810,000.%0a%0a>>alert-message block-message info%3c%3c%0a810,000 > (econ * 100) + Fleet + Technology%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0aWith all technology required for Planetary Rings, Merovech usually has%0aless than 340,000 technology. He keeps his fleet to under 150,000. Under%0athis formula, he needs to keep his economy under 3,200. He could double%0ahis fleet to 300,000 and keep his economy under 2,100 and stayed below%0aLevel-30. However, this leaves him vulnerable to Levels above 37, which%0ageometrically increased his vulnerability. So, at Level-27, Merovech%0astarted building five of the ten necessary Planetary Rings to defend his%0abases.%0a%0aWhen at the beginning of a server, staying under Level 30 does not%0amatter. However, Merovech typically stays under Level 30 out of habit.%0aHe keeps as few as 500 Fighters overhead, the rest of his fleet is%0amobile. With 10 bases, 500 Fighters total only 25,000 total fleet. As%0aMerovech adds one base per month, he typically has 12 bases by the time%0ahe builds prings.%0a%0aEach base met or slightly exceeds the minimum construction goals of the%0a[[Advanced Base Guide]], with a 19:15:8:2 MR:RF:NF:AF [[production structures]] %0aratio. The bases also had Command Centers-10, and in many%0acases Spaceports-15. When building prings on an Asteroid, these%0astructures complete the work in under six days; depending on your%0aCybernetics. It normally takes Merovech 10 days to build prings on a%0aMoon. Merovech never settles on a Planet.%0a%0a(:bburl #standards:)%0aStandards%0a=========%0a%0aThis section offers a suggested set of personal standards the player%0ashould strive to. The fundamental goal is to ensure you have enough%0adefenses to deter a profit-seeker, and enough fleet to protect the trade%0aroutes.%0a%0aCommand Centers%0a---------------%0a%0aThe table below offers standards for Command Centers based on economy;%0athough Merovech argues more than 10 is a waste of space after prings.%0aThe goal is to boost your defensive fleet's power to reduce your rival's%0aability to take your trade routes. At base essentially increases its%0aeconomy by 20 percent per trade route, so the requirement follows. The%0aMetal Refinery column is for those who like to balance their structure%0abuilds.

Weaker turrets provide substantially less%0aprotection as the base economy increases.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0aShields%0a---------------%0a%0aThe rule for shields is easy. When you have researched enough for%0aDeflection shields, build one level. When you have researched Planetary%0aShields, you build two. Disband the Deflection Shields when the first%0aPlanetary Shield is built. The net result is Pring-15, Pshield-10.%0a%0aFleet%0a------%0a%0aDefense fleets protect the trade routes. Before you have prings,%0aconstrain yourself to self-trades or short-distance (%3c1000 paces)%0atrades. This reduces profits made by the attacker. Once you have prings,%0ayou can start moving toward long-distance trades (LD trades). You should%0aalso push for Dread tech to protect your LD trades. As Dreads use the%0asame technology as prings, make sure you pay attention to Warp tech.%0a%0aHow much fleet? Merovech's calculations is one Dread for every 7,400%0apaces of trades. That's about seven power per pace. While a Dread is%0ainefficient against Cruisers, Heavy Cruisers and Battleships, the base%0aprings will kill any of those units not killed by the Dreads---leveling%0athe playing field.%0a%0a>>alert-message block-message warning%3c%3c%0aWhen relying on base prings to cover Dreads, do _not_ use that pring in%0acalculating the base defense coverage! It either supports the base or%0athe trades. Otherwise, an attacker can hit the base, the trades and%0acollect the derbs for a modest profit.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0aConclusion%0a==========%0a%0aTo have adequate defenses, the player needs to ensure they have a%0abalance of fleet, command centers and base defenses. The fleet protects%0aitself and the trade routes and benefits from the Command Centers. The%0abase defenses should be able to offset the pillage bonus, plus a ratio%0aof the cash-in-hand. With this model followed, a base is an inefficient%0atarget, but is still vulnerable to a motivated rival. This guide seeks%0ato inform the player in an approach to analyzing base defenses, but%0aexpects the player to adjust to his specific needs. This guide further%0aseeks to show the player that Astro Empires is a bean-counting endeavor,%0aand that taking time to look at the underlying structure helps find%0aefficient ways to play the game.%0a%0a[[!Sidebar]] [[!Guides]]%0a%0a(:comment This page has been edited using Pywe:)%0a(:title Base Defense Guide:)

To ignore%0a%3c any of these aspects is to jeopardize one's enjoyment of the game.  This%0a%3c guide discusses the defensive structures and offers a structure for when%0a%3c to have what mode of base defense.%0a%3c %0a%3c Motivation%0a%3c ==========%0a%3c %0a%3c As with the [[Small Fleet Doctrine]], this guide is about efficiencies.%0a%3c You are trying to raise the efficiency of your defenses to reduce the%0a%3c efficiency of your rivals. If he is going to take your base, you need%0a%3c to ensure he does not profit in the exchange. Generally, wise rivals%0a%3c only attack bases that are likely to turn a profit. The question becomes%0a%3c what is profit? Defenses generally deter those who are after momentary%0a%3c financial gain. Some rivals have other motives: power, shame, control and%0a%3c the strategic goal of suppressing an opponent in war are other%0a%3c reasons why a rival might hit your base. To defend against these%0a%3c motives, a player's only real defense is a strong mobile fleet that he%0a%3c closely shepherds. That mobile fleet is the purpose of the [[Small Fleet Doctrine]].%0a%3c %0a%3c There are essentially three things your base defenses protect. The%0a%3c obvious first benefactor is the base itself: its economy and%0a%3c productivity. The second benefactor is that base's trade. The other%0a%3c benefactor is the fleet in orbit over that base.%0a%3c %0a%3c Strategy%0a%3c ========%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (:table cellspacing=0:)%0a%3c (:cellnr:)10%0a%3c (:cell:)54%0a%3c (:cell:)140%0a%3c (:cell:)10584%0a%3c (:cellnr:)20%0a%3c (:cell:)216%0a%3c (:cell:)150%0a%3c (:cell:)12150%0a%3c (:cellnr:)30%0a%3c (:cell:)486%0a%3c (:cell:)160%0a%3c (:cell:)13824%0a%3c (:cellnr:)40%0a%3c (:cell:)864%0a%3c (:cell:)170%0a%3c (:cell:)15606%0a%3c (:cellnr:)50%0a%3c (:cell:)1350%0a%3c (:cell:)180%0a%3c (:cell:)17496%0a%3c (:cellnr:)60%0a%3c (:cell:)1944%0a%3c (:cell:)190%0a%3c (:cell:)19494%0a%3c (:cellnr:)70%0a%3c (:cell:)2646%0a%3c (:cell:)130%0a%3c (:cell:)9126%0a%3c (:cellnr:)80%0a%3c (:cell:)3456%0a%3c (:cell:)120%0a%3c (:cell:)7776%0a%3c (:cellnr:)90%0a%3c (:cell:)4374%0a%3c (:cell:)110%0a%3c (:cell:)6534%0a%3c (:cellnr:)100%0a%3c (:cell:)5400%0a%3c (:cell:)200%0a%3c (:cell:)21600%0a%3c (:tableend:)%0a%3c     %0a%3c %0a%3c Defenses%0a%3c ========%0a%3c %0a%3c Command Centers (CC)%0a%3c --------------------%0a%3c %0a%3c Each Command Center boosts your overall defensive power by five percent.%0a%3c Veterans will build ten to fifteen CCs on a base to improve the power of%0a%3c the defensive fleet up to 75 percent. Building ten is considered%0a%3c reasonable for a free player. A Heavy Cruiser with 10 CCs and medium%0a%3c plasma research (10-15 levels) will dish out 125 points of damage.%0a%3c Command Centers protect the overhead fleet, which protects trade routes.%0a%3c %0a%3c Turrets%0a%3c ~~~~~~~%0a%3c %0a%3c Turrets are grouped together%0a%3c %0a%3c Most defenders will%0a%3c keep two of their best turrets until they get to Disrupter Turrets, then%0a%3c they will build 4 or more of the D-Turrets.%0a%3c %0a%3c The major selling point of the Ion Turrets is the shielding they have,%0a%3c which helps them against unshielded units. Ion is also a cheaper%0a%3c technology to research. Ion technology is required for Pshields.%0a%3c However, Photon technology delivers a better punch and is required for%0a%3c Pring technology. So, unless you have an urgent need, consider bypassing%0a%3c Ion Turrets in favor of Photon Turrets.%0a%3c %0a%3c Pshields%0a%3c ~~~~~~~~%0a%3c %0a%3c Exactly what are Planetary Shields? On an initial attack, they provide%0a%3c an extra layer of shielding for base defenses (not fleet). The%0a%3c attacker's power is evenly distributed among the defenses. so if there%0a%3c were two defense installation types (ion and photon turrets), then%0a%3c instead of spliting the power in half and applied to each type, the%0a%3c power is split into a third.%0a%3c %0a%3c After each attack, any remaining armor on the Pshield is automatically%0a%3c redistributed to all base defenses. So, say you have only Pshields and%0a%3c Disrupter Turrets.  The enemy attacks and takes out your Turrets, but%0a%3c the Pshields still have 1000 Armour (per unit of shield, remember groups%0a%3c of five). As soon as the attack is complete, the Pshield distributes 500%0a%3c points to the turrets, which could repower twice as many Turrets as the%0a%3c Pshield. So, the shields are at 1/4 strength (500 points), and the%0a%3c Turrets are almost to full strength. Ouch.  With the weak power in a%0a%3c Pshield, if it is your only defense, then a patient Heavy Cruiser could%0a%3c effectively reduce your defenses piecemeal.%0a%3c %0a%3c Prings%0a%3c ~~~~~~~%0a%3c %0a%3c Planetary Rings are the first true deterrant to capital ships. A bank of%0a%3c Prings delivers 15,360 points of Photonic trouble to any%0a%3c attacker.(:footnote Remember, the power and armor shown in the Tables page of AE is before you apply the bonus for technology. You need Photon-10, which raises the base Power by 50 percent:)%0a%3c %0a%3c That is enough to waste two Death Stars, 14 Titans, or 1150%0a%3c Cruisers. Two Prings is considered ``safe," three is secure. Four Prings%0a%3c means the owner is paranoid---and can deal 61,440 distructive points to%0a%3c any attacker (2300 Cruisers gone). %0a%3c %0a%3c ``Pringles" is a term for a pair of Prings and Pshields. When you finish%0a%3c a set of Pringles, then you can start downsizing your defensive fleet.%0a%3c Or, more accurately, you can get those lazy bums into the attack. With%0a%3c Pringles-2, you can usually drop your defenses down to about 4000 FT and%0a%3c 2 BB.%0a
