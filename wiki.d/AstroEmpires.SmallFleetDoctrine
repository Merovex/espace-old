text=(:title Small Fleet Doctrine:)%0a'''Updated November 2009.''' Astro Empires is a game of military economy. This guide advocates%0adeploying a more efficient fleet than one's rival under the term %0a``Small Fleet Doctrine."%0a[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeune_Ecole|Historically]], the Small%0aFleet Doctrine was developed by the French to counter the naval%0asupremacy of the Britsh Royal Navy. Rather than focus on capital ships.%0athe French devised a solution wherein Escort ships could be %0aused.(:footnote This was generally an unsuccessful doctrine, although the use of submarines is an application of this doctrine that was effective in WWI and WWI.:)%0a%0aThere are two dominant fleet doctrines in Astro Empires: Balanced and%0aEfficient. The primary one is balanced, which mandates a balanced ratio%0aof each unit in the fleet. The Efficient Doctrine is similar, but it%0alooks at the relative efficiency of units in suggesting which units to%0aadd to your fleets. Ironically, the Efficient Fleet Doctrine demurs in%0athe use of capital ships; much like the French Small Fleet Doctrine.%0aTherefore, this guide honors the naval heritage of a doctrine that%0aadvocates for more efficient, smaller units and labels it the Small%0aFleet Doctrine. %0a%0aAt its core, AE is still a rock-paper-scissors game.%0aUnit efficiency is relative to the units used by your rival.%0aEfficiency is an economic term that describes a condition without waste.%0aSo, a more-efficient fleet is one that produces less economic waste.%0aThe objective is to cause the most damage to your opponent for the least%0acost---cost-efficiency. This guide, therefore, discusses the different%0aunits and their relative efficiency to one another, and how to develop%0aan efficient fleet.%0aThe first section discusses the role of each fleet unit. %0aThe second section touches on base defense structures.%0aThe third section discusses implementation of the Small Fleet Doctrine.%0aOnce you have read through this article, we encourage you to read about%0a[[NapkinCombat|how to manually plan attacks]].%0a%0a[[!Guides]]%0a%0a'''All you need to know.''' If you do not care to read the entire%0aarticle, then here is all you probably need to know. Build Fighters to%0atake out meat (support) ships. Build Heavy Bombers and Cruisers to take%0aout escort ships. Ion Frigates, Ion Bombers, Battleships and Heavy Cruisers (in that%0aorder) are ideal against Capitals. In high numbers (think thousands),%0aCruisers are the most efficient shielded unit against Escorts, Planetary%0aRings and Capitals. In high numbers (think hundred-thousands), Fighters%0aare the most efficient unit against everything.  In keeping with this%0adoctrine, do not build anything larger than a Battleship. On the%0aoffensive, always bring with you enough Recyclers to mop up all the%0adebris at the tick.%0a%0a(:*toc:)%0a%0aFleet Composition%0a=================%0a%0aThe core problem with balanced fleet doctrine is that it convinces%0apeople that they need to build and use units that are unnecessary in a%0afleet.  This gives your opponents an opportunity to destroy your fleet%0amore efficiently. Balance is important. However, building units merely%0ato create balance means you will spend too much to build a fleet. Your%0acombat will suffer as you will not earn as much as you spend---the%0aPyrric victory. In this Section, we discuss each unit and their role in%0aan efficient fleet. This precedes a short set of points to remember.%0a%0aGeneral Unit Advice%0a-------------------%0a%0aThis sub-section provides general comments on the fleet units in Astro%0aEmpires.%0a%0aThere are four ship classes this guide recognizes:%0a%0a* Support (Meat) Ships: (Fighers to Frigates).%0a* Escort Ships: These are large, units (Cruiser, Heavy Cruisers and Battleships).%0a* Capital Ships: These are massive units (Dreadnought and larger).%0a* Utility Ships: These are units you should never put into combat.%0a%0aGenerally speaking, your support fleet should be mostly Fighters with%0asome Destroyers. Escort ships should comprise a balance of Cruisers and%0aHeavy Cruisers. In the Small Fleet approach, capital ships are%0agenerally not built because of their inefficiency.%0a%0a[[#chart]]%0a(:include AstroEmpires/UnitsAtAGlance:)%0a%0aSupport Ships%0a-------------%0a%0aGenerally speaking, there are three support (meat) units you want in%0abattle: Fighters, Heavy Bombers and Destroyers. Fighters are the best in%0akilling unshielded units. Heavy Bombers are effective in killing Escorts%0awhen there is no enemy Fighter support. Destroyers are also highly%0aeffective against Escorts; again when there is no enemy Fighter support.%0aCorvettes are useful in raider, emergency resupply roles.%0a%0a* Fighters: Anti-support%0a* H.Bombers (Bombers): Anti-escort%0a* Destroyers: Anti-escort (until you have H.Bombers)%0a* Corvettes: Fast Raiders%0a%0aWe now look at the support units in greater detail.%0a%0aFighters (FT)%0a~~~~~~~~~~~~~%0a%0a%25green%25'''Build this unit.'''%25%25 %0aThese are the staple of all fleets in AE---defense, offense, everything.%0aFighters are the single most efficient ship in Astro Empires. The damage%0athey absorb per credit is unparalleled. That makes Fighters your primary%0aunit for use as cannon fodder. It is literal to say that you can never%0ahave too many Fighters. A fleet that runs out of Fighters will take far%0ahigher losses, and can be defeated in detail for obscene exchange rates%0aby anyone who manages to catch them. Build thousands for base defense,%0aand then keep building them for use with offensive fleets.  You go%0athrough Fighters at an obscene rate because Fighters are basically%0adesigned to die. Application of Fighter waves in combat can%0asignificantly improve your exchange rate.%0a%0aBombers (BO)%0a~~~~~~~~~~~~%0a%0a%25color=#CC6600%25'''Consider this unit.'''%25%25 %0aBombers have the same armor as Fighters with twice the firepower and%0atwice the cost. This makes them slightly less efficient. While less%0aefficient, they can still be slightly efficient meat. Their ability to%0aharm Cruisers makes them especially handy in the offense _until_ you%0ahave Heavy Bombers. Use them in an anti-Cruiser role. Their relative%0aefficiency over Heavy Bombers makes them more useful than their%0acounterpart in an _offensive_ role.%0a%0aHeavy Bombers (HB)%0a~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%0a%0a%25color=green%25'''Build this unit.'''%25%25 %0aHeavy Bombers are primarily *offensive units*. They carry enough punch%0ato take out escort units---Cruisers and Heavy Cruisers---but their%0avulnerability to other support units and cost makes them poor defensive%0aunits.  Enemy Fighters will cut them to ribbons.  Heavy Bombers are best%0aused in waves after your Fighter waves destroy the enemy's unshielded%0aunits. %0a%0a>>note%3c%3c%0aHBs are ideal units for breaking occupations, if you have a%0aproper amount of Command Centers.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0aIon Bombers (IB)%0a~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%0a%0a%25color=#CC6600%25'''Consider this unit.'''%25%25%0aIon Bombers support an anti-capital role but are highly vulnerable to Fighters due to their low shielding. Ion Frigates, below, have a substantially higher ratio against Capital, however.%0a%0aCorvettes%0a~~~~~~~~~%0a%0a%25color=#CC6600%25'''Consider this unit.'''%25%25 %0aThe Corvette utility lies in its speed. They are not very useful in a%0abattle fleet because they are too expensive compared to other support%0aunits. They are as efficient as Bombers, but their unique ability makes%0athem better suited elsewhere. Because of shielding, CVs are considered inefficient against shielded units; unless high enough numbers of CVs are present.%0a%0aCorvettes are also generally viewed as an armed scout, able to pick off rival Outpost Ships and Scouts (generally early in the game). Being smaller than Scouts, they are detected only briefly before landing. However, they lack Warp ability, preventing them from trans-galactic travel without a Jump Gate.%0a%0aCorvettes are also good in a raider role. Build 500 or more and camp them at%0aa Jump Gate for Recycler hunting and emergency resupply. They can also%0abe used to hunt naked Frigates, if so inclined. They do not need hangars%0ato travel between astros. Therefore, emergency resupply might help a%0afleet with insufficient Fighter support.%0a%0aDestroyers (DDs, tin cans)%0a~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%0a%0a%25green%25'''Build this unit.'''%25%25 %0aBecause Cruisers and Destroyers share the Plasma weapons system,%0aDestroyers are useful. They are very efficient in destroying naked%0aCruisers and Heavy Cruisers. They are inefficient against Battleships%0aand Capital ships. They are also very inefficient against Fighter waves.%0aSo, when your opponent has a large Cruiser/Heavy Cruiser fleet,%0aDestroyers are your counter-balance. %0a%0aOne tactic is to keep a lot of Destroyers at a Jump Gate to rush%0aCruisers or strengthen base reinforcements. They are especially useful%0awith Command Centers, playing havoc with the enemy ratios. Their speed%0amakes them handy at Recycler hunting. Because they are unshielded, do%0anot leave Destroyers in hostile territory when you have to be offline.%0a%0aFrigates (FR)%0a~~~~~~~~~~~~~%0a%0a%25color=#CC6600%25'''Consider this unit.'''%25%25 %0aFrigates have a mixed reputation. Small Fleet used to discourage Frigate construction. However, the value of Frigates is not that cut-and-dried. Lacking shields, they are highly vulnerable to Fighters. They have a .33 cost/armor ratio to a Fighter's .88 ratio; which shows what you stand to lose when caught off guard. However, diligently used, Frigates are a decent tool, marginally efficient against Cruisers (.33 to .28 cost/armor ratio), and can carry Fighters (raising the overall efficiency). A Frigate/Fighter mix costs 100 credits, requires 10 Recyclers to support, and can be a lethal, quick combination...with diligence.%0a%0aEscort Ships%0a------------%0a%0aEscort ships are __shielded__ units that are generally capable of warp%0atravel. They retain some vulnerability to support ships but primarily%0aserve in an anti-capital, anti-escort role. This is a small class of%0aships, but your fleet should comprise a considerable percentage of it.%0a%0a* Ion Frigate: Anti-Capital%0a* Cruiser: Anti-Escort%0a* Heavy Cruiser: Anti-Fighter, Anti-Capital (Titans and smaller)%0a* Battleship: Anti-Fighter, Anti-Capital (Titans and larger)%0a%0aWe now look at the escort units in greater detail.%0a%0aIon Frigates (IF)%0a~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%0a%0a%25color=#CC6600%25'''Consider this unit.'''%25%25%0aIon Frigates are units of limited utility. With a high-enough Ion level (e.g. over 15), they provide the best ratios (upward of 3.9) against Levis and Death Stars---all capital ships. Combining them with Ion Bombers (two per IF) packs a stronger punch, but with a lower ratio (2.6); requiring fewer units.%0a%0a* Against LV: 1200 to 1250 Ion Frigates per LV%0a* Against TI: 350 to 400 Ion Frigates per TI%0a* Against Dreads: about 100 Ion Frigates per Dread%0a %0aCruisers (CR)%0a~~~~~~~~~~~~~%0a%0a%25green%25'''Build this unit.'''%25%25 In Small Fleet Doctrine, Cruisers serve%0aa critical role. You will want to build these by the hundreds. They are%0athe efficient killer of escort units (Heavy Cruisers and Battleships).%0aThey are less efficient against Fighters than Heavy Cruisers, and should%0anever be used to ``naked rush" Fighters. They are inefficient against%0aTitans and larger when your plasma tech is optimized. Cruisers protect%0ayour support fleet from Heavy Cruisers and Battleships. They are%0avulnerable against Heavy Bombers and Destroyers. %0a%0aCruisers are the most efficient shielded unit for taking out Planetary%0aRings (Prings), but it takes a hundreds of them. Make sure you have%0aenough. Regardless, Cruisers should be the backbone of your main battle%0afleets.%0a%0aHeavy Cruisers (HC)%0a~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%0a%0a%25green%25'''Build this unit.'''%25%25 %0aHeavy Cruisers are the bruiser of Astro Empires. %0aTheir shields are high enough to let them nakedly rush Fighters. %0aThey are inefficient against Heavy Bombers and Destroyers, and should%0ahave Fighter support in that attack. %0aHeavy Cruisers are efficient killers of capital ships (Dreadnoughts and Titans). %0aWhen your rivals start building capital ships, then start building this unit. %0aThey are less efficient in main fleets where there are no capital ships.%0aTitans are massively inefficient against Heavy %0aCruisers.(:footnote you need only one-quarter the point value in HCs to kill a Titan:)%0aHowever, Leviathans are massively ''efficient'' against HCs.%0aDeath Stars are ''immune'' to Heavy Cruisers, but Death Stars are%0afloating credit %0abanks.(:footnote Before the October change, veterans referred to capital ships as debris in a can because escort ships could more-efficiently destroy them:)%0aTherefore, you do not need build these until you start seeing Dreadnoughts and%0aTitans.%0a%0aBattleships (BS)%0a~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%0a%0a%25color=#CC6600%25'''Consider this unit.'''%25%25 %0aAs ships get larger, they tend to become less efficient. %0aThey are significantly efficient against support units, able to destroy%0amore than 12 times their value in Fighters and Heavy Bombers.%0aThey are inefficient against escort ships. %0aTherefore, use Battleships to destroy support fleet in coordination with%0aCruisers and Heavy Cruisers.%0a%0aIn an anti-capital role, Battleships are generally grossly inefficient. %0aThey are balanced against Dreadnoughts. %0aThey are less efficient than Heavy Cruisers against Titans.%0aThey are the most efficient escort ship for killing Leviathans (but%0astill require nearly three times the fleet).%0aThey are very efficient against Death Stars.%0aTherefore, do not build Battleships for in an anti-capital role until%0ayou are faced with Leviathans and Death Stars.%0a%0aCapital Ships%0a-------------%0a%0aCaptial Ships are the massive units that provide bragging rights to%0asenior players. To younger players, they provide shock-and-awe. However,%0athe bigger units get, the less efficient they are. The big stuff is best used%0aagainst things that cannot hurt it. Small Fleet Doctrine discourages%0abuilding any of these units until you have a firm grasp on their use and%0acan effectively destroy your rival's capital units and defend your own.%0a%0aDreadnoughts (DN)%0a~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%0a%0aThe strength of these units is their shields. They are great for%0aattacking bases that have defenses weaker than Disruptor Turrets,%0aprovided the defense fleet is not large enough to have a chance at%0akilling the Dreadnought. %0a%0aDreadnoughts are a fair addition to combat fleets when attacking things%0athat cannot kill them and are willing to tolerate the long travel times.%0aIf a Dreadnought would be destroyed in the attack, it is preferable to%0aleave it out. Otherwise, a safe Dreadnought will help soak damage that%0awould otherwise destroy other units. Therefore, think of Dreadnoughts as%0ainefficient, floating shields.%0a%0aDreadnoughts find their best value in trade route defense. When coupled%0awith a pring, a Dread can efficiently defend 7,400 paces of trade%0aroutes. While a Dread may efficiently be destroyed by Heavy Cruisers and%0aBattleships, the prings would kill whatever was brought in to kill the%0aDread. This causes at best a break-even situation for the attacker.%0a%0aTitans (TI)%0a~~~~~~~~~~~%0a%0aTitans are massively inefficient against Heavy Cruisers and Battleships.%0aThey are able to destroy Cruisers effectively because of the Titan's%0ashielding. However, the terrible speed and terrible efficiency of the%0aTitan mean you should leave them off your list. %0aTwenty Battleships will kill a naked Titan,%0aas will 130 HCs; assuming technology is the same.  The HCs should yield %0aabout a 2:1 kill ratio, while the BBs will yield around 1.5:1.  %0aTitans are great to send out solo to smash bases with defenses less than rings.%0a%0aLeviathan%0a~~~~~~~~~~%0a%0aLevianthans are allegedly useful for taking bases with Disruptor%0aTurrets. However, they are still massively inefficient against a%0adetermined escort force. One should accept that taking bases is a%0aterrible objective. The real objective is destroying your opponent's%0afleet and collecting the debris. Levies are best used in stacks to chomp%0aopposing fleet. However, if caught off guard a destroyed Levi stack%0amight make the owner cry.%0a%0aUtility Ships%0a-------------%0a%0aUtility Ships are those ships which you need, but should never be used%0ain combat. This guide does not discuss Outpost Ships as they have one%0aobvious, limited role.%0a%0a>>note%3c%3c%0aAlways retreat utility ships before attacking. They are not meant for fleet%0aoperations.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a%0aRecyclers (RC)%0a~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%0a%0aThese are not combat units. However, they are critical to successful%0afleet operations. Resource denial is key to waging war in Astro Empires.%0aYou should probably have at least 1000 for effective hit-and-run%0atactics.%0a%0aCarriers (CA)%0a~~~~~~~~~~~~~%0a%0aSupport ships (mostly Fightes) are useless outside the base that built%0athem because they need transportation. Carriers are the smallest unit%0athat can carry Fighters by the boat load.  They have less survivability%0athan Fleet Carriers, but they are also faster. Keep a group at your%0ajumpgates for rapid reinforcement. %0a%0aFleet Carriers (FC)%0a~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%0a%0aFleet Carriers sacrifice speed for survivability and portage. They have%0astrong enough shields to shield-rape small units. If you have a%0acalculator and you are very careful, it's possible to include FCs in%0aattacks to improve ratios. This is dangerous, though. Avoid this unless%0ayou are experienced. You should have lots of FCs to move all your%0aFighters around. Although, if speed is your goal and you are hunting%0awith Cruisers, keep using Carriers.%0a%0aMajor Points to Remember%0a------------------------%0a%0aHere are the most important parts for review:%0a%0a* Fighters and Cruisers should be the bulk of your fleet---70 percent your total fleet size.%0a* Keep enough HCs around to deal with the big stuff, with more than that if you want to use them in main fleets.%0a* Do not build Frigates, Ion Frigates, or Ion Bombers. You are wasting your production time and money.%0a* Bigger is not always better. The bigger you get, the less efficient you get. Do not build too much of the big stuff.%0a%0aSmall Fleet Doctrine Applied%0a============================%0a%0aFrom the previous sections, we learn that the most efficient units are%0aFighters, Cruisers and Heavy Cruisers. We also learn that other units%0acan be efficient under the right circumtances. The essence of SFD is to%0aknow thine enemy. This requires you intelligently determine your rival's%0atechnology levels. You investigate his fleet to determine where the%0achinks in the armor are. However, Small Fleet assumes that Heavy%0aCruisers are generally the largest unit you will build.%0a%0aSpying on Your Rival%0a--------------------%0a%0aHow do you find your rival's technology? Sneak a Scout or Corvette into%0ahis fleet. You run through the attack sequence, stopping at the point%0awhere you would have to confirm the attack. You are rewarded with the%0apower, armour and shield of his units. Cancel the attack and recover%0ayour spy. Use the values to calculate your needs.%0a%0aWhat is his compostion? If there are a lot of Fighters, you will have to%0aoperate inefficiently to get rid of them. Calculate how many Fighters%0ayou need to kill his. That is your first wave. Are there many Cruisers?%0aThen bring more Destroyers. If there are many Heavy Cruisers, then bring%0amore Cruisers. Et cetera.%0a%0aNormal Fleet Strength%0a---------------------%0a%0aIn a defensive role, you should plan to cover your weaknesses. You will%0awant a heavy Fighter support. Normal doctrine suggests 35 percent of%0athe point value of your fleet will be Fighters. Another 40 percent%0ashould be Cruisers and Heavy Cruisers.%0a%0aUpdates%0a=======%0a%0a'''November 2009.''' Refined descriptions of Ion Bombers and Frigates to%0acorrect errors in anti-capital role. Added use of Corvette in a scout%0arole, something Merovech has used for some time but was just lax in%0adocumenting.%0a%0a(:comment This page has been edited using Pywe:)%0a(:title Small Fleet Doctrine:)

If taking your base costs too much (in terms%0a%3c of pillage, trade routes and debris verse what he expends) and he%0a%3c attacks you anyway, then he's really doing you and your guild a service%0a%3c by weakening himself for the counter attack.%0a%3c %0a402,403c384%0a%3c Twenty Command Centers doubles the punch of any unit or defense.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> %0a414,433c395,397%0a%3c technology to research. Ion technology is required for Pshields.%0a%3c However, Photon technology delivers a better punch and is required for%0a%3c Pring technology. So, unless you have an urgent need, consider bypassing%0a%3c Ion Turrets in favor of Photon Turrets.%0a%3c %0a%3c Pshields%0a%3c ~~~~~~~~%0a%3c %0a%3c Exactly what are Planetary Shields? On an initial attack, they provide%0a%3c an extra layer of shielding for base defenses (not fleet). After the%0a%3c attack, any remaining energy is automatically redistributed to all base%0a%3c defenses. So, say you have only Pshields and Disrupter Turrets. The%0a%3c enemy attacks and takes out your Turrets, but the Pshields still have%0a%3c 1000 Armour (per unit of shield, remember groups of five). As soon as%0a%3c the attack is complete, the Pshield distributes 500 points to the%0a%3c turrets, which could repower twice as many Turrets as the Pshield. So,%0a%3c the shields are at 1/4 strength (500 points), and the Turrets are almost%0a%3c to full strength. Ouch.%0a%3c %0a%3c Prings%0a---%0a> technology to research.%0a> %0a> P-Rings%0a436,450c400,404%0a%3c Planetary Rings are the first true deterrant to capital ships. A bank of%0a%3c Prings delivers 15,360 points of Photonic trouble to any%0a%3c attacker---30,720 if you have twenty Command Centers.(:footnote%0a%3c Remember, the power and armor is before you apply the bonus for%0a%3c technology. You need Photon-10, which raises the base Power by 50%0a%3c percent:)That is enough to waste two Death Stars, 14 Titans, or 1150%0a%3c Cruisers. Two Prings is considered ``safe," three is secure. Four Prings%0a%3c means the owner is paranoid---and can deal 122,880 distructive points to%0a%3c any attacker (4600 Cruisers gone). %0a%3c %0a%3c ``Pringles" is a term for a pair of Prings and Pshields. When you finish%0a%3c a set of Pringles, then you can start downsizing your defensive fleet.%0a%3c Or, more accurately, you can get those lazy bums into the attack. With%0a%3c Pringles-2, you can usually drop your defenses down to about 4000 FT and%0a%3c 2 BB.%0a---%0a> This is not a unit, but a defense.  P-rings are the first deterrant to%0a> capital ships. Most players get P-Shield tech way before P-Ring tech.%0a> While the P-Shield won't protect you from capital ships, they ''will''%0a> protect you from the currently rampaging Cruiser and in lesser degree HC%0a> fleets. %0a

There are three%0a> types of fleet doctrine.%0a> %0a> Now that you have a decent grasp on the roles of your combat units, it's time to see how these varying roles affects your fleet composition. There are three main types of combat doctrine you will so your opponents using: balanced fleet doctrine, efficiency doctrine, and what I call e-p*n*s doctrine. That's how I think of them, anyway. In the case of e-p*n*s doctrine, it's not really a doctrine at all; it's a fallacious belief that bigger is better. A lot of people are entirely too top-heavy, and since the most expensive ships are generally the least efficient, you get huge kill ratios from them.%0a> %0a> '''Efficiency Doctrine.''' Efficiency Doctrine is basically just balanced doctrine evolved. Under balanced doctrine, you should have equal armor values of different units. That's all well and good, but against a thinking opponent, your fleets can be dismantled easily. The problem with balanced doctrine is that it frequently leads people to build less efficient ship types to mix into their fleets to soak damage from other types of ships. Against someone fighting efficiently, you are going to get owned.%0a> %0a> Dismantling a Balanced Fleet%0a> ----------------------------%0a> %0a> Let's take the example from the Art of War post. Your balanced fleet looks like this:%0a> %0a> [@%0a> 1 Dreadnought = 512 Armor%0a> 4 Battleships = 512 Armor%0a> 16 Heavy Cruisers = 768 Armor%0a> 32 Cruisers = 768 Armor%0a> 96 Destroyers = 768 Armor%0a> 192 Corvettes = 768 Armor%0a> 192 Heavy Bomber's = 768 Armor%0a> 384 Bomber's = 768 Armor%0a> 384 Fighter's = 768 Armor%0a> @]%0a> %0a> The total credit value of this fleet is 51,600 credits. (I'm leaving out%0a> the Fleet Carriers since they are not intended as combat units if it can be avoided.)

Total losses: 25025. Enemy losses: 51600. Voila! 2:1 ratio.%0a> %0a> This is the problem with balanced doctrine. If you use a lot of%0a> different unit types, it does in fact disperse the damage across them.%0a> The problem is, any ''unshielded unit is vulnerable to Fighters'', which%0a> are the most efficient unit in the game. Use a battle calculator to find%0a> how many Fighters you need to attack with in one wave to destroy all the%0a> unshielded units. Drop that many and no more; overkill just wastes%0a> Fighters and ruins your ratios as the enemy's shielded units kill the%0a> extra Fighters with practically no losses. Once the enemy's unshielded%0a> units are gone, you send in the Cruisers---which are the most efficient%0a> ship to kill the shielded units---with the remaining Fighters as a%0a> meatshield. By using only your most efficient units, you come out well%0a> ahead in the exchange.%0a> %0a> The spirit of balanced doctrine, though, is that you should have enough%0a> meat to protect your larger ships. This is an important concept. If you%0a> attacked with 200 Cruisers and 20 Fighters after the enemy had lost%0a> their unshielded units, you would finish the same fight with nothing but%0a> 121 Cruisers, for 27400 in losses and a slightly weaker ratio. No matter%0a> what your fleet composition is, you should always make sure you have%0a> enough of your most efficient ships to soak damage from the less%0a> efficient.%0a> %0a> This goes back to the idea that you can never have too many Fighters. If%0a> you are running a battle calculator and you come out of a fight with 0%0a> Fighters, you do not have enough. You should always end up with some%0a> Fighters remaining because if you run out, the damage they would have%0a> absorbed is being transferred to your more expensive ships.%0a> %0a> Efficiency FTW%0a> --------------%0a> %0a> With Fighters being the most efficient unshielded unit and Cruisers%0a> being the most efficient shielded unit, the two together make the most%0a> well-rounded combat fleet in the game. If you have good balance between%0a> Cruisers and Fighters, your fleet has no significant weakness. Fighter%0a> waves meet with a negative exchange ratio. Attacking with Destroyers%0a> gets about a 2:1 ratio against naked Cruisers, but the Fighters get%0a> about 2.5:1 against Destroyers, so the two together cover one another's%0a> weaknesses.%0a> %0a> If faced with a fleet of Cruisers and Fighters, you've got to take poor%0a> ratios to get rid of the Fighters before you can get good ratios on the%0a> Cruisers, unless you've got a Levi or something to shield-rape the%0a> Cruisers into submission. The best you can do is eat the bad ratios%0a> against the Fighters be dropping in a wave of your own Fighters and then%0a> follow up with Destroyers for a 2:1 ratio if you are capable. You are%0a> usually not able to manage that, so you may as well just run into them%0a> with your own Cruiser/Fighter unit for even odds and let the debris%0a> compensate for your lack of winning ratio.%0a> %0a> In order to put together efficient fleets, you need to know your target.%0a> Cruisers and Fighters are usually the most efficient fleet. Bear in%0a> mind, you should have Carriers/Fleet Carriers to ferry around Fighters;%0a> while Cruisers can carry four Fighters each, that's not nearly enough%0a> for long-term operations. Fighters are disposable, so keep plenty in%0a> supply. Heavy Cruisers are more efficient against everything up to%0a> Titans and Leviathans, and close to equal with Cruisers in efficiency%0a> against Dreadnoughts. Unshielded units are always vulnerable to Fighter%0a> waves, so leaving these as part of a combat fleet in enemy territory is%0a> asking for poor ratios. (They have their place, certainly; we covered%0a> that in Volume I.) Using unshielded units in an assault can be fine,%0a> don't get me wrong; in the event that you are using a large-scale fleet%0a> with many unit types, a la balanced doctrine, having extra ship types to%0a> balance the damage out can save your ratios. Most of the time, though,%0a> you should have that many unit types in your fleets because it forces%0a> you to use less efficient means of soaking damage.%0a> %0a> Efficiency doctrine is just about taking balanced doctrine and distilling it down to its core. Balanced doctrine seeks to achieve efficiency by using cheaper units to protect the larger units. Efficiency doctrine eliminates the less efficient units from the fleet entirely, distilling attack fleets down to their most efficient elements. That doesn't mean you should build nothing but Fighters and Cruisers, but it does mean they should make up a very large portion of your fleet. Make sure you have a strong Heavy Cruiser contingent for the big stuff. Keeping a few BBs and DNs around can be handy, but don't go overboard with the large units.%0a> %0a> That's all for now, people. By now you should be on your way to becoming a force to be reckoned with. Keep your eyes peeled for more.%0a> %0a> You have some idea how to put fleets together, so let's cover how to use them.%0a> %0a> I live by a simple motto: "That which does not kill me has made a grave tactical error." If the enemy is not putting you under pressure, he's letting you take initiative and dictate the pace and the stakes of the conflict. Accept that offer.%0a> %0a> Strategic Thinking%0a> ==================%0a> %0a> Every now and then, a guild in AstroEmpires gets the genius idea to%0a> turtle simultaneously during a major war. The idea may look good on the%0a> surface---base defenses and Command Centers vastly increase exchange%0a> rates, so why not keep your fleet above your planets where they can reap%0a> the benefits? Surely you can break the enemy's back this way!%0a> %0a> Well, it's an idea. Granted, it's one that goes against thousands of%0a> years of military strategy. It may look good on paper, but the fact is%0a> initiative is too valuable an asset in war. If you sit back and wait for%0a> your enemy to come to you, he will. And he'll do it with overwhelming%0a> force. You'll get good exchange rates, and then your enemy will scoop%0a> all the debris and turn it into fleet to replace his losses. Meanwhile,%0a> all your fleet was at home where it just got smashed, so you have no%0a> hope of liberating your bases. Because your enemy was under no pressure,%0a> he could amass a force to come after you at his leisure. It's the same%0a> reason hackers are always one step ahead of security: It's impossible to%0a> create an impregnable defense. If you have a determined enemy who knows%0a> what he's dealing with---all he has to do is sit a scout somewhere in%0a> the region to watch you---then he can figure out exactly what he needs%0a> to break your defenses. Given time, he'll put together a fleet to break%0a> you, and he doesn't have to worry about uncovering one of his systems to%0a> do it because he's not under any pressure.%0a> %0a> A winning strategy is one that ''takes the initiative''. Aggression forces%0a> your opponent to worry about protecting his own assets. Half the reason%0a> I'm riding people about defenses is so they will have bases that their%0a> enemies are afraid to attack. Some people would rather look for another%0a> target than attack a base with two sets of disruptors and deflectors.%0a> Once you get p-rings and p-shields, people really hate messing with you.%0a> If your enemy is weak or timid, he'll stall forever before attacking%0a> you, waiting to get more fleet online to make sure they have%0a> overwhelming odds. Hit one of his bases during this span, and he may%0a> never hit you back if you are well defended. If you just stepped up and%0a> hit him in the mouth, he'll be too worried about leaving himself open to%0a> another attack to go on the offensive. You've got him thinking about how%0a> you hurt him, not about how he can hurt you.%0a> %0a> Conditioning Your Enemy%0a> -----------------------%0a> %0a> Remember how I said fingerpainting with your enemy's viscera while laughing hysterical is more intimidating than being know as an honorable warrior? Well, we're in the strategy section now, so let's start getting into that. When a war first kicks off, I like to employ a tactic that I call Pavlov's Rapetrain. The first enemy aggression will almost invariably occur against the weakest friendly bases in the area. These are simply attacks of opportunity. Soft targets provide an easy economy boost for the enemy. Everyone does it.%0a> %0a> Still, attacking a soft target shows initiative, and that's something we%0a> don't want to see out of our opponents. On top of that, it may sometimes%0a> bely an unwillingness to attack except from a position of extreme%0a> superiority. I say sometimes, because that's not necessarily the case; I%0a> hit soft targets early, too, when I know where they are. It's good%0a> business; it boosts your economy, you can get in and out quickly because%0a> there won't be much debris to scoop, and it immediately lets your%0a> opponent know you are willing to dance. The enemy is sending a message. Pavlov's Rapetrain is about replying to that message.%0a> %0a> It's fairly simple---first one to show aggression rides the rapetrain. It%0a> doesn't matter how well-defended he is. It doesn't matter if there are%0a> softer targets around. The soft targets don't pose a threat. Not only%0a> have they shown no aggression, but they are also easy meat for whenever%0a> you get around to them. Focus on the enemy aggressors, and knock them%0a> back on their heels. Pick one of their production bases---as a bonus,%0a> these are frequently jumpgate worlds, and often house a large fleet if%0a> it's not out on assault duty---and smash it. These are usually well%0a> defended worlds, and you will take significant losses in order to break%0a> them. If you don't have enough fleet to take it without being crippled,%0a> coordinate with guildmates. Don't break yourself to send a message, but%0a> if you don't have enough fleet to take one base without breaking%0a> yourself, you really aren't ready for war yet to begin with.%0a> %0a> This is all about sending a message back to him. You want to show him%0a> that no matter how well defended he is, he always has to worry about you%0a> hitting him. Don't let him feel safe simply because he has p-rings up.%0a> Roll in with a thousand Cruisers and show him how little you worry about%0a> his rings. You want him to worry about sending his fleet to the front%0a> because he may need it back home.%0a> %0a> Now, while preparing for the attack, coordinate with any guildmates in%0a> your area to locate and destroy each of his bases. If he hits one soft%0a> target and suddenly finds himself ass deep in debris that the enemy is%0a> feeding on, commanding an empire of ruined planets, chances are he's%0a> going to be less aggressive in the future. You want to teach him that%0a> aggression is dangerous, and force him into a timid, defensive mindset.%0a> You are also taking the first aggressors of the war and making an example%0a> of them. I employed this tactic in the Beta War, and the aggressor that%0a> I hit never assaulted one of our planets in that galaxy again. Only one%0a> member of his guild ever attacked one of our planets in that galaxy%0a> after those attacks. You want his guild to see the price he pays for%0a> aggression. The psychological effect you have on your opponents may be%0a> enough to take the initiative from them permanently.%0a> %0a> The easy targets are probably still going to be easy targets later.%0a> Teach the more active and aggressive players what happens when they%0a> attack. If you can get them to fallaciously think they weren't defending%0a> their planets well enough, they'll keep more of their fleet at home%0a> where you don't have to worry about it.%0a> %0a> Tempo and Resource Denial%0a> -------------------------%0a> %0a> There's more to war in AstroEmpires than just destroying the other guy's%0a> fleet and getting good ratios. You can get 3:1 ratios all day long and%0a> still let your enemy come out ahead if you neglect the debris. '''ATTACKING AN ENEMY, SMASHING THEIR FLEET, AND THEN MOVING ON AND LEAVING THE DEBRIS BEHIND IS NOT A VICTORY'''. This is a very important concept. It may%0a> look like you just won, but if you let him have the debris, you haven't%0a> really done anything because all that debris is going to be converted%0a> back into fleet. Fleet replacement is absolutely essential in a%0a> protracted engagement; it's very possible for your fleet numbers to%0a> actually go up during a war if you are getting maintaining good ratios%0a> and getting most of the debris.%0a> %0a> Because of this dynamic, the pace of your offensive is limited by your%0a> ability to clean up debris. The more recyclers you have, the faster you%0a> can move along. If you've got 1000 Cruisers just waiting to tear your%0a> enemy apart, you had better not have neglected to build recyclers to%0a> follow in their wake. Simply smashing the enemy's fleet and moving along%0a> only costs him the time it takes to rebuild; the debris left by the%0a> combined losses of the engagement will pay for most of the damage.%0a> %0a> '''Caveat:''' That doesn't mean that raiding tactics are worthless. The%0a> economy hit that is dealt to planet when it is occupied is significant,%0a> and it takes a long time to fully regenerate. If you don't have the%0a> ability to lock down the area and harvest the debris before moving%0a> along, but your combat fleet has plenty of fight left in it, employing%0a> blitzkrieg tactics and rapidly hitting several of an enemy's bases can%0a> deal a massive blow to his economy, even if you are not occupying those%0a> bases in the long-term. The problem with this is even if he doesn't have%0a> the recyclers available to get the debris himself, he's going to call%0a> guildies in to feast, and large amounts of debris may go into the hands%0a> of dangerous players.%0a> %0a> You don't have to get every last scrap of debris you create, but you%0a> want to get as much as possible even if you don't need the money. Notice%0a> that this section isn't called Resource Harvesting. Resource denial%0a> means just that---you are not gathering it because you need it; you are%0a> gathering it because your opponent does, and he can't have it if you get%0a> it first.%0a> %0a> To this end, you should have a large recycler fleet. If you have%0a> anything less than 1000 recyclers, you shouldn't plan to launch any kind%0a> of fast-moving offensive without debris-collecting support form your%0a> guildmates. If you have priority targets to hit and you made too big of%0a> a mess to clean up and move to the next target quickly, call in your%0a> guildies. Don't be selfish with debris; the economic boost is nice, but%0a> keeping it away from the enemy is nicer. If you can't empty the debris%0a> pile yourself in a reasonable amount of time, call in backup. If you%0a> know you are going to be making a large mess in an assault or series of%0a> assaults and you won't be able to get much of the debris, notify your%0a> guildmates in the area before you launch your offensive so they can get%0a> recyclers in a position to start eating debris as soon as possible. If%0a> you've got four guildmates in the area and each of you has 1000%0a> recyclers, your combined RC fleets will harvest 50,000 credits worth of%0a> debris per hour. Not only that, but it doesn't actually take an hour to%0a> process debris; you only have to have your recyclers there for the%0a> debris processing update, which comes at half past the hour. With good%0a> timing, your vulnerable recyclers may only be available targets for a%0a> minute or two, and then a huge chunk of debris is gone.%0a> %0a> Don't leave your recyclers stationary in enemy territory if you want to%0a> keep them. They are priority targets for everyone, and you simply cannot%0a> protect them. Since they are unshielded units, Fighter attacks or suicide%0a> runs from Corvettes can wipe them out no matter how much additional%0a> fleet you have there to protect them.%0a> %0a> Speaking of suiciding Corvettes, you should have a fleet on standby,%0a> ready to hunt down enemy recyclers whenever you spot them. I start%0a> building more Corvettes any time my number of Corvettes in commission%0a> drops below 1000. Corvettes are the fastest attack ship in the game,%0a> which makes them ideal for recycler hunting. Don't expect for your%0a> Corvettes to survive an especially long time, though; if you find%0a> recyclers in the middle of a large fleet, suicide enough Corvettes into%0a> the fleet to kill the recyclers. Recyclers are always a priority target.%0a> You can take more time scooping debris if you destroy your opponent's%0a> ability to claim it.%0a> %0a> Advanced Logistics%0a> ------------------%0a> %0a> Keeping the wheels of war turning requires good logistics. Part of that%0a> is simply fleet replacement; while you are running amok and taking your%0a> opponent's bases, your production queues should be running full bore%0a> back home to keep your force levels the same (or to keep them on the%0a> rise). If things are going well and you are getting a lot of money from%0a> debris, feel free to use Fast Production. You don't want to be sitting%0a> on large stacks of cash if you get pillaged in war.%0a> %0a> >>note%3c%3c%0a> Note: It's a common but incorrect belief that you lose money when you%0a> get pillaged. You don't. But the amount of cash you have on hand is part%0a> of the equation that determines how large the enemy pillage is, and you%0a> don't want to give him money if he hits you. Let him work for the debris%0a> like everyone else. Don't let him get 20k a pop instantly because you are sitting on too much money)%0a> >>%3c%3c%0a> %0a> The trickier part of logistics is resupply. The biggest limiting factor%0a> on a fleet's utility is its Fighter supply. I cannot stress to you the%0a> ridiculous number of Fighters you will go through in large engagements.%0a> I've dropped 6000 Fighters just in one wave before. That's not even%0a> counting the Fighters I used in the main fleet. If you are butting heads%0a> with large fleets, you will burn through Fighters at a rate that rivals%0a> Lindsey Lohan's cocaine consumption. Once you are out of Fighters, your fleet is vulnerable and your ratios are screwed. Rapid resupply is essential to continuing fleet function.%0a> %0a> The ideal way to keep a fleet functioning is to keep it in supply. Fleet%0a> Carriers are essential in combat fleets, with their high survivability%0a> saving you tons of credits if you get caught flat-footed. They make poor%0a> resupply vessels, though, because they are not as fast. Regular carriers%0a> are far easier to kill, but are also 33%25 faster than Fleet Carriers.%0a> This makes them ideal as rear echelon units. They are never intended to%0a> see combat. The idea is to dispatch your resupply carriers from a%0a> jumpgate, drop off their Fighter compliment for the FCs in the field to%0a> pick up, and then run them back home. In my opinion, Carriers should%0a> only be built for resupply purposes, or for when you need to get more%0a> Fighter transport up fast. Fleet Carriers not only have higher%0a> survivability, but they also have more hangar space per credit spent%0a> than Carriers do---even if it's not by much. Carriers serve a very%0a> specific role once you get FCs, and this is it. Keep plenty of Fighters%0a> at the jumpgate where the carriers are on standby, and trying to keep%0a> enough bombers and heavy bombers on hand to fill your carriers for those%0a> instances when your enemy is vulnerable to a bomber or HB drop. Focus on%0a> Fighters, though.%0a> %0a> Sometimes you won't be able to resupply in time, and you've got the%0a> enemy breathing down you neck. You may have taken a strategic point that%0a> you are not yet willing to vacate, but you are going to get pounded if you%0a> stay because you don't have enough meat left in the fleet. This is the%0a> other function of Corvettes. Deploying from a decent jumpgate will%0a> almost invariably get Corvettes to your wounded fleet in time for battle%0a> unless you've already let the enemy sneak up on you. Corvettes aren't as%0a> efficient as meat as Fighters are, but their armor-per-credit is equal%0a> to bombers. Sometimes Corvettes are the best you can do, but they'll%0a> save you thousands in fleet in the long run.%0a> %0a> In the event that you have a large fleet in a relatively secure galaxy%0a> but the neighboring galaxies have a smaller guild presence, you may want%0a> to build up a cache of Fighters at a friendly base in the neighboring%0a> galaxy so that you have a resupply point for your fleet if you send%0a> reinforcements that way during war. This takes a lot of preparation%0a> time, and means you'll have one less campaign fleet to work with. Still,%0a> it's well worth it if you think you may have reason to send%0a> reinforcements to that galaxy in the future. Half the time, you'll eat%0a> through most of your Fighter compliment in three or four strikes,%0a> leaving your fleet to either make a stand and get crushed for lousy%0a> ratios or to head all the way back to your home galaxy to resupply. If%0a> you've built up a supply of Fighters beforehand, your fleet will have%0a> much greater longevity before it is forced to withdraw.%0a> %0a> Okay, that's it for now, folks. I'll get to Volume IV in the near%0a> future. Pat yourself on the back if you actually read this hulking%0a> monstrosity. All questions, comments, threats, random cursing, and%0a> name-calling are welcome.  Back to top 	View user's profile Send private%0a> message 	 	%0a> %0a> ----%0a> %0a> Okay so the exact change to the combat system is as such. Previously all%0a> units would spread out their damage evenly amongst all targets they%0a> could do damage too, while only about 1%25 of the damage dealt by a stack%0a> would cause damage to each stack of units it could not breech the%0a> shields of. Confusing yes, I know. So I give you an example:%0a> %0a> >>example%3c%3c%0a> You have 1000 Fighters and the enemy has 500 Fighters, 300 Corvettes, 4%0a> Heavy Cruisers and a set of Disruptor Turrets. Assuming base technology%0a> your Fighters would do 2000 points of damage, 20 damage (1%25 of damage)%0a> would hit the Disruptors, 20 damage (1%25) would hit the Heavy Cruisers,%0a> and 980 damage (49%25) would hit each stack of Fighters and Corvettes.%0a> >>%3c%3c%0a> %0a> The change has been made now, that instead of 1%25, 5%25 of damage is sent%0a> at each of the unit stacks that Fighters could not otherwise damage.%0a> This reduces the effect of Fighter drops because you'll need more%0a> Fighters to destroy the same amount of unshielded ships as you%0a> previously needed.%0a> %0a> As a result, I am recommending the building of heavy shielded ships,%0a> like Heavy Cruisers and Battleships in your defensive screens, even if%0a> you have P-Rings. This will reduce the effectiveness of Fighter drops%0a> significantly, as Heavy Cruisers and Battleships will absorb 5x more of%0a> the firepower that would otherwise hit your smaller units under the old%0a> system. Whether the system is changed back or not is beyond my guess,%0a> but for now, this is how it works. Also, take this into account when%0a> attacking large stacks of fleet. Fighter drops will be ineffective%0a> against planets with multiple layers of defenses (Ions, Photons,%0a> Disruptors, D-shields, P-shields, Rings all absorb 5%25 of attack damage%0a> now) and heavy and super capital ships.%0a

diff:1194804832:1194804832:=1,837d0%0a%3c This guide discusses the Small Fleet Doctrine.%0a%3c [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeune_Ecole|Historically]], the Small%0a%3c Fleet Doctrine was developed by the French to counter the naval%0a%3c supremacy of the Britsh Royal Navy. Rather than focus on capital ships.%0a%3c the French devised a solution wherein Escort ships could be used.%0a%3c %0a%3c There are two dominant fleet doctrines in Astro Empires: Balanced and%0a%3c Efficient. The primary one is balanced, which mandates a balanced ratio%0a%3c of each unit in the fleet. The Efficient Doctrine is similar, but it%0a%3c looks at the relative efficiency of units in suggesting which units to%0a%3c add to your fleets. Ironically, the Efficient Fleet Doctrine demurs in%0a%3c the use of capital ships; much like the French Small Fleet Doctrine.%0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, this guide honors the naval heritage of a doctrine that%0a%3c advocates for more efficient, smaller units and labels it the Small%0a%3c Fleet Doctrine. At its core, AE is still a rock-paper-scissors game.%0a%3c Build your fleet in a way that will more likely counter your opponent's%0a%3c fleet. Throughout this guide, ``efficient" describes the%0a%3c cost-effectiveness of a unit compared to other units.%0a%3c %0a%3c [[!Sidebar]]%0a%3c %0a%3c (:*toc:)%0a%3c %0a%3c Basic Ship Strategy%0a%3c ===================%0a%3c %0a%3c The core problem with balanced fleet doctrine is that it convinces%0a%3c people that they need to build and use ships that are unnecessary in a%0a%3c fleet.  This gives your opponents an opportunity to destroy your fleet%0a%3c more efficiently. Balance is important. However, building units merely%0a%3c to create balance means you will spend too much to build a fleet. Your%0a%3c combat will suffer as you will not earn as much as you spend---they%0a%3c Pyrric victory. In this Section, we discuss each unit and their role in%0a%3c an efficient fleet. This precedes a short set of points to remember.%0a%3c %0a%3c General Unit Advice%0a%3c -------------------%0a%3c %0a%3c This sub-section provides general comments on the fleet units in Astro%0a%3c Empires.%0a%3c %0a%3c There are four ship classes this guide recognizes:%0a%3c %0a%3c * Support (Meat) Ships: (Fighers to Frigates).%0a%3c * Escort ships: These are large, ships (Cruiser, Heavy Cruisers and Battleships).%0a%3c * Capital Ships: These are massive ships (Dreadnought and larger).%0a%3c * Utility Ships: These are ships you should never put into combat.%0a%3c %0a%3c Generally speaking, your support fleet should be mostly Fighters with%0a%3c some Destroyers. Escort ships should comprise a balance of Cruisers and%0a%3c Heavy Cruisers. In the Small Fleet approach, capital ships are%0a%3c generally not built because of their inefficiency.%0a%3c %0a%3c Support Ships%0a%3c -------------%0a%3c %0a%3c Generally speaking, there are three support (meat) ships you want in%0a%3c battle: Fighters, Heavy Bombers and Destroyers. Fighters are the best in%0a%3c killing unshielded units. Heavy Bombers are effective in killing Escorts%0a%3c when there is no enemy Fighter support. Destroyers are also highly%0a%3c effective against Escorts; again when there is no enemy Fighter support.%0a%3c Corvettes are useful in raider, emergency resupply roles.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Fighters: Anti-support%0a%3c * H.Bombers (Bombers): Anti-escort%0a%3c * Destroyers: Anti-escort%0a%3c * Corvettes: Fast Raiders%0a%3c %0a%3c Fighters (FT)%0a%3c ~~~~~~~~~~~~~%0a%3c %0a%3c %25green%25'''Build this unit.'''%25%25 %0a%3c These are the staple of all fleets in AE---defense, offense, everything.%0a%3c Fighters are the single most efficient ship in the game. The damage they%0a%3c absorb per credit is unparalleled. That makes Fighters your primary unit%0a%3c for use as cannon fodder. When we say you can never have too many%0a%3c Fighters, we're being quite literal.

You are wasting your production time and money.%0a%3c * Bigger is not always better. The bigger you get, the less efficient you get. Do not build too much of the big stuff.%0a%3c %0a%3c Overview of Fleet Doctrines%0a%3c ===========================%0a%3c %0a%3c >>note%3c%3c%0a%3c Under revision%0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c %0a%3c This section provies an overview of fleet doctrines. There are three%0a%3c types of fleet doctrine.%0a%3c %0a%3c Now that you have a decent grasp on the roles of your combat units, it's time to see how these varying roles affects your fleet composition. There are three main types of combat doctrine you will so your opponents using: balanced fleet doctrine, efficiency doctrine, and what I call e-p*n*s doctrine. That's how I think of them, anyway. In the case of e-p*n*s doctrine, it's not really a doctrine at all; it's a fallacious belief that bigger is better. A lot of people are entirely too top-heavy, and since the most expensive ships are generally the least efficient, you get huge kill ratios from them.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Efficiency Doctrine.''' Efficiency Doctrine is basically just balanced doctrine evolved. Under balanced doctrine, you should have equal armor values of different units. That's all well and good, but against a thinking opponent, your fleets can be dismantled easily. The problem with balanced doctrine is that it frequently leads people to build less efficient ship types to mix into their fleets to soak damage from other types of ships. Against someone fighting efficiently, you are going to get owned.%0a%3c %0a%3c Dismantling a Balanced Fleet%0a%3c ----------------------------%0a%3c %0a%3c Let's take the example from the Art of War post. Your balanced fleet looks like this:%0a%3c %0a%3c [@%0a%3c 1 Dreadnought = 512 Armor%0a%3c 4 Battleships = 512 Armor%0a%3c 16 Heavy Cruisers = 768 Armor%0a%3c 32 Cruisers = 768 Armor%0a%3c 96 Destroyers = 768 Armor%0a%3c 192 Corvettes = 768 Armor%0a%3c 192 Heavy Bomber's = 768 Armor%0a%3c 384 Bomber's = 768 Armor%0a%3c 384 Fighter's = 768 Armor%0a%3c @]%0a%3c %0a%3c The total credit value of this fleet is 51,600 credits. (I'm leaving out%0a%3c the Fleet Carriers since they are not intended as combat units if it can be avoided.) Now, let's see how this balanced fleet fares against an equal-value fleet of Fighters and Cruisers (transports not included) with some basic Fighter wave tactics.%0a%3c %0a%3c Let's say this is the other fleet:%0a%3c %0a%3c [@%0a%3c 3120 Fighters%0a%3c 180 Cruisers%0a%3c @]%0a%3c %0a%3c That's it. No frills. We'll assume equal tech levels for both fleets. These two fleets aren't going to clash directly, though. The attacking fleet of Cruisers/Fighters will first perform a Fighter drop to take out the unshielded units.%0a%3c %0a%3c [@%0a%3c 2300 Fighters%0a%3c %0a%3c vs.%0a%3c %0a%3c 1 Dreadnought%0a%3c 4 Battleships%0a%3c 16 Heavy Cruisers%0a%3c 32 Cruisers%0a%3c 96 Destroyers%0a%3c 192 Corvettes%0a%3c 192 Heavy Bombers%0a%3c 384 Bombers%0a%3c 384 Fighters%0a%3c @]%0a%3c %0a%3c After the Fighter wave, the balanced fleet is left with this:%0a%3c %0a%3c [@%0a%3c 1 Dreadnought%0a%3c 4 Battleships%0a%3c 16 Heavy Cruisers%0a%3c 32 Cruisers%0a%3c @]%0a%3c %0a%3c Whoops! Not so balanced anymore. Bring in the Cruisers, and the formerly balanced fleet gets cut to ribbons.%0a%3c %0a%3c [@%0a%3c 820 Fighters%0a%3c 180 Cruisers%0a%3c %0a%3c vs.%0a%3c %0a%3c 1 Dreadnought%0a%3c 4 Battleships%0a%3c 16 Heavy Cruisers%0a%3c 32 Cruisers%0a%3c %0a%3c =%0a%3c %0a%3c 252 Fighters%0a%3c 137 Cruisers%0a%3c %0a%3c vs.%0a%3c %0a%3c 0.1 Battleship%0a%3c 0.69 Dreadnought%0a%3c @]%0a%3c %0a%3c One more attack, and the assault force is left with 155 Fighters and 129%0a%3c Cruisers. Total losses: 25025. Enemy losses: 51600. Voila! 2:1 ratio.%0a%3c %0a%3c This is the problem with balanced doctrine. If you use a lot of%0a%3c different unit types, it does in fact disperse the damage across them.%0a%3c The problem is, any ''unshielded unit is vulnerable to Fighters'', which%0a%3c are the most efficient unit in the game. Use a battle calculator to find%0a%3c how many Fighters you need to attack with in one wave to destroy all the%0a%3c unshielded units. Drop that many and no more; overkill just wastes%0a%3c Fighters and ruins your ratios as the enemy's shielded units kill the%0a%3c extra Fighters with practically no losses. Once the enemy's unshielded%0a%3c units are gone, you send in the Cruisers---which are the most efficient%0a%3c ship to kill the shielded units---with the remaining Fighters as a%0a%3c meatshield. By using only your most efficient units, you come out well%0a%3c ahead in the exchange.%0a%3c %0a%3c The spirit of balanced doctrine, though, is that you should have enough%0a%3c meat to protect your larger ships. This is an important concept. If you%0a%3c attacked with 200 Cruisers and 20 Fighters after the enemy had lost%0a%3c their unshielded units, you would finish the same fight with nothing but%0a%3c 121 Cruisers, for 27400 in losses and a slightly weaker ratio. No matter%0a%3c what your fleet composition is, you should always make sure you have%0a%3c enough of your most efficient ships to soak damage from the less%0a%3c efficient.%0a%3c %0a%3c This goes back to the idea that you can never have too many Fighters. If%0a%3c you are running a battle calculator and you come out of a fight with 0%0a%3c Fighters, you do not have enough. You should always end up with some%0a%3c Fighters remaining because if you run out, the damage they would have%0a%3c absorbed is being transferred to your more expensive ships.%0a%3c %0a%3c Efficiency FTW%0a%3c --------------%0a%3c %0a%3c With Fighters being the most efficient unshielded unit and Cruisers%0a%3c being the most efficient shielded unit, the two together make the most%0a%3c well-rounded combat fleet in the game. If you have good balance between%0a%3c Cruisers and Fighters, your fleet has no significant weakness. Fighter%0a%3c waves meet with a negative exchange ratio. Attacking with Destroyers%0a%3c gets about a 2:1 ratio against naked Cruisers, but the Fighters get%0a%3c about 2.5:1 against Destroyers, so the two together cover one another's%0a%3c weaknesses.%0a%3c %0a%3c If faced with a fleet of Cruisers and Fighters, you've got to take poor%0a%3c ratios to get rid of the Fighters before you can get good ratios on the%0a%3c Cruisers, unless you've got a Levi or something to shield-rape the%0a%3c Cruisers into submission. The best you can do is eat the bad ratios%0a%3c against the Fighters be dropping in a wave of your own Fighters and then%0a%3c follow up with Destroyers for a 2:1 ratio if you are capable. You are%0a%3c usually not able to manage that, so you may as well just run into them%0a%3c with your own Cruiser/Fighter unit for even odds and let the debris%0a%3c compensate for your lack of winning ratio.%0a%3c %0a%3c In order to put together efficient fleets, you need to know your target.%0a%3c Cruisers and Fighters are usually the most efficient fleet. Bear in%0a%3c mind, you should have Carriers/Fleet Carriers to ferry around Fighters;%0a%3c while Cruisers can carry four Fighters each, that's not nearly enough%0a%3c for long-term operations. Fighters are disposable, so keep plenty in%0a%3c supply. Heavy Cruisers are more efficient against everything up to%0a%3c Titans and Leviathans, and close to equal with Cruisers in efficiency%0a%3c against Dreadnoughts. Unshielded units are always vulnerable to Fighter%0a%3c waves, so leaving these as part of a combat fleet in enemy territory is%0a%3c asking for poor ratios. (They have their place, certainly; we covered%0a%3c that in Volume I.) Using unshielded units in an assault can be fine,%0a%3c don't get me wrong; in the event that you are using a large-scale fleet%0a%3c with many unit types, a la balanced doctrine, having extra ship types to%0a%3c balance the damage out can save your ratios. Most of the time, though,%0a%3c you should have that many unit types in your fleets because it forces%0a%3c you to use less efficient means of soaking damage.%0a%3c %0a%3c Efficiency doctrine is just about taking balanced doctrine and distilling it down to its core. Balanced doctrine seeks to achieve efficiency by using cheaper units to protect the larger units. Efficiency doctrine eliminates the less efficient units from the fleet entirely, distilling attack fleets down to their most efficient elements. That doesn't mean you should build nothing but Fighters and Cruisers, but it does mean they should make up a very large portion of your fleet. Make sure you have a strong Heavy Cruiser contingent for the big stuff. Keeping a few BBs and DNs around can be handy, but don't go overboard with the large units.%0a%3c %0a%3c That's all for now, people. By now you should be on your way to becoming a force to be reckoned with. Keep your eyes peeled for more.%0a%3c %0a%3c You have some idea how to put fleets together, so let's cover how to use them.%0a%3c %0a%3c I live by a simple motto: "That which does not kill me has made a grave tactical error." If the enemy is not putting you under pressure, he's letting you take initiative and dictate the pace and the stakes of the conflict. Accept that offer.%0a%3c %0a%3c Strategic Thinking%0a%3c ==================%0a%3c %0a%3c Every now and then, a guild in AstroEmpires gets the genius idea to%0a%3c turtle simultaneously during a major war. The idea may look good on the%0a%3c surface---base defenses and Command Centers vastly increase exchange%0a%3c rates, so why not keep your fleet above your planets where they can reap%0a%3c the benefits? Surely you can break the enemy's back this way!%0a%3c %0a%3c Well, it's an idea. Granted, it's one that goes against thousands of%0a%3c years of military strategy. It may look good on paper, but the fact is%0a%3c initiative is too valuable an asset in war. If you sit back and wait for%0a%3c your enemy to come to you, he will. And he'll do it with overwhelming%0a%3c force. You'll get good exchange rates, and then your enemy will scoop%0a%3c all the debris and turn it into fleet to replace his losses. Meanwhile,%0a%3c all your fleet was at home where it just got smashed, so you have no%0a%3c hope of liberating your bases. Because your enemy was under no pressure,%0a%3c he could amass a force to come after you at his leisure. It's the same%0a%3c reason hackers are always one step ahead of security: It's impossible to%0a%3c create an impregnable defense. If you have a determined enemy who knows%0a%3c what he's dealing with---all he has to do is sit a scout somewhere in%0a%3c the region to watch you---then he can figure out exactly what he needs%0a%3c to break your defenses. Given time, he'll put together a fleet to break%0a%3c you, and he doesn't have to worry about uncovering one of his systems to%0a%3c do it because he's not under any pressure.%0a%3c %0a%3c A winning strategy is one that ''takes the initiative''. Aggression forces%0a%3c your opponent to worry about protecting his own assets. Half the reason%0a%3c I'm riding people about defenses is so they will have bases that their%0a%3c enemies are afraid to attack. Some people would rather look for another%0a%3c target than attack a base with two sets of disruptors and deflectors.%0a%3c Once you get p-rings and p-shields, people really hate messing with you.%0a%3c If your enemy is weak or timid, he'll stall forever before attacking%0a%3c you, waiting to get more fleet online to make sure they have%0a%3c overwhelming odds. Hit one of his bases during this span, and he may%0a%3c never hit you back if you are well defended. If you just stepped up and%0a%3c hit him in the mouth, he'll be too worried about leaving himself open to%0a%3c another attack to go on the offensive. You've got him thinking about how%0a%3c you hurt him, not about how he can hurt you.%0a%3c %0a%3c Conditioning Your Enemy%0a%3c -----------------------%0a%3c %0a%3c Remember how I said fingerpainting with your enemy's viscera while laughing hysterical is more intimidating than being know as an honorable warrior? Well, we're in the strategy section now, so let's start getting into that. When a war first kicks off, I like to employ a tactic that I call Pavlov's Rapetrain. The first enemy aggression will almost invariably occur against the weakest friendly bases in the area. These are simply attacks of opportunity. Soft targets provide an easy economy boost for the enemy. Everyone does it.%0a%3c %0a%3c Still, attacking a soft target shows initiative, and that's something we%0a%3c don't want to see out of our opponents. On top of that, it may sometimes%0a%3c bely an unwillingness to attack except from a position of extreme%0a%3c superiority. I say sometimes, because that's not necessarily the case; I%0a%3c hit soft targets early, too, when I know where they are. It's good%0a%3c business; it boosts your economy, you can get in and out quickly because%0a%3c there won't be much debris to scoop, and it immediately lets your%0a%3c opponent know you are willing to dance. The enemy is sending a message. Pavlov's Rapetrain is about replying to that message.%0a%3c %0a%3c It's fairly simple---first one to show aggression rides the rapetrain. It%0a%3c doesn't matter how well-defended he is. It doesn't matter if there are%0a%3c softer targets around. The soft targets don't pose a threat. Not only%0a%3c have they shown no aggression, but they are also easy meat for whenever%0a%3c you get around to them. Focus on the enemy aggressors, and knock them%0a%3c back on their heels. Pick one of their production bases---as a bonus,%0a%3c these are frequently jumpgate worlds, and often house a large fleet if%0a%3c it's not out on assault duty---and smash it. These are usually well%0a%3c defended worlds, and you will take significant losses in order to break%0a%3c them. If you don't have enough fleet to take it without being crippled,%0a%3c coordinate with guildmates. Don't break yourself to send a message, but%0a%3c if you don't have enough fleet to take one base without breaking%0a%3c yourself, you really aren't ready for war yet to begin with.%0a%3c %0a%3c This is all about sending a message back to him. You want to show him%0a%3c that no matter how well defended he is, he always has to worry about you%0a%3c hitting him. Don't let him feel safe simply because he has p-rings up.%0a%3c Roll in with a thousand Cruisers and show him how little you worry about%0a%3c his rings. You want him to worry about sending his fleet to the front%0a%3c because he may need it back home.%0a%3c %0a%3c Now, while preparing for the attack, coordinate with any guildmates in%0a%3c your area to locate and destroy each of his bases. If he hits one soft%0a%3c target and suddenly finds himself ass deep in debris that the enemy is%0a%3c feeding on, commanding an empire of ruined planets, chances are he's%0a%3c going to be less aggressive in the future. You want to teach him that%0a%3c aggression is dangerous, and force him into a timid, defensive mindset.%0a%3c You are also taking the first aggressors of the war and making an example%0a%3c of them. I employed this tactic in the Beta War, and the aggressor that%0a%3c I hit never assaulted one of our planets in that galaxy again. Only one%0a%3c member of his guild ever attacked one of our planets in that galaxy%0a%3c after those attacks. You want his guild to see the price he pays for%0a%3c aggression. The psychological effect you have on your opponents may be%0a%3c enough to take the initiative from them permanently.%0a%3c %0a%3c The easy targets are probably still going to be easy targets later.%0a%3c Teach the more active and aggressive players what happens when they%0a%3c attack. If you can get them to fallaciously think they weren't defending%0a%3c their planets well enough, they'll keep more of their fleet at home%0a%3c where you don't have to worry about it.%0a%3c %0a%3c Tempo and Resource Denial%0a%3c -------------------------%0a%3c %0a%3c There's more to war in AstroEmpires than just destroying the other guy's%0a%3c fleet and getting good ratios. You can get 3:1 ratios all day long and%0a%3c still let your enemy come out ahead if you neglect the debris. '''ATTACKING AN ENEMY, SMASHING THEIR FLEET, AND THEN MOVING ON AND LEAVING THE DEBRIS BEHIND IS NOT A VICTORY'''. This is a very important concept. It may%0a%3c look like you just won, but if you let him have the debris, you haven't%0a%3c really done anything because all that debris is going to be converted%0a%3c back into fleet. Fleet replacement is absolutely essential in a%0a%3c protracted engagement; it's very possible for your fleet numbers to%0a%3c actually go up during a war if you are getting maintaining good ratios%0a%3c and getting most of the debris.%0a%3c %0a%3c Because of this dynamic, the pace of your offensive is limited by your%0a%3c ability to clean up debris. The more recyclers you have, the faster you%0a%3c can move along. If you've got 1000 Cruisers just waiting to tear your%0a%3c enemy apart, you had better not have neglected to build recyclers to%0a%3c follow in their wake. Simply smashing the enemy's fleet and moving along%0a%3c only costs him the time it takes to rebuild; the debris left by the%0a%3c combined losses of the engagement will pay for most of the damage.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Caveat:''' That doesn't mean that raiding tactics are worthless. The%0a%3c economy hit that is dealt to planet when it is occupied is significant,%0a%3c and it takes a long time to fully regenerate. If you don't have the%0a%3c ability to lock down the area and harvest the debris before moving%0a%3c along, but your combat fleet has plenty of fight left in it, employing%0a%3c blitzkrieg tactics and rapidly hitting several of an enemy's bases can%0a%3c deal a massive blow to his economy, even if you are not occupying those%0a%3c bases in the long-term. The problem with this is even if he doesn't have%0a%3c the recyclers available to get the debris himself, he's going to call%0a%3c guildies in to feast, and large amounts of debris may go into the hands%0a%3c of dangerous players.%0a%3c %0a%3c You don't have to get every last scrap of debris you create, but you%0a%3c want to get as much as possible even if you don't need the money. Notice%0a%3c that this section isn't called Resource Harvesting. Resource denial%0a%3c means just that---you are not gathering it because you need it; you are%0a%3c gathering it because your opponent does, and he can't have it if you get%0a%3c it first.%0a%3c %0a%3c To this end, you should have a large recycler fleet. If you have%0a%3c anything less than 1000 recyclers, you shouldn't plan to launch any kind%0a%3c of fast-moving offensive without debris-collecting support form your%0a%3c guildmates. If you have priority targets to hit and you made too big of%0a%3c a mess to clean up and move to the next target quickly, call in your%0a%3c guildies. Don't be selfish with debris; the economic boost is nice, but%0a%3c keeping it away from the enemy is nicer. If you can't empty the debris%0a%3c pile yourself in a reasonable amount of time, call in backup. If you%0a%3c know you are going to be making a large mess in an assault or series of%0a%3c assaults and you won't be able to get much of the debris, notify your%0a%3c guildmates in the area before you launch your offensive so they can get%0a%3c recyclers in a position to start eating debris as soon as possible. If%0a%3c you've got four guildmates in the area and each of you has 1000%0a%3c recyclers, your combined RC fleets will harvest 50,000 credits worth of%0a%3c debris per hour. Not only that, but it doesn't actually take an hour to%0a%3c process debris; you only have to have your recyclers there for the%0a%3c debris processing update, which comes at half past the hour. With good%0a%3c timing, your vulnerable recyclers may only be available targets for a%0a%3c minute or two, and then a huge chunk of debris is gone.%0a%3c %0a%3c Don't leave your recyclers stationary in enemy territory if you want to%0a%3c keep them. They are priority targets for everyone, and you simply cannot%0a%3c protect them. Since they are unshielded units, Fighter attacks or suicide%0a%3c runs from Corvettes can wipe them out no matter how much additional%0a%3c fleet you have there to protect them.%0a%3c %0a%3c Speaking of suiciding Corvettes, you should have a fleet on standby,%0a%3c ready to hunt down enemy recyclers whenever you spot them. I start%0a%3c building more Corvettes any time my number of Corvettes in commission%0a%3c drops below 1000. Corvettes are the fastest attack ship in the game,%0a%3c which makes them ideal for recycler hunting. Don't expect for your%0a%3c Corvettes to survive an especially long time, though; if you find%0a%3c recyclers in the middle of a large fleet, suicide enough Corvettes into%0a%3c the fleet to kill the recyclers. Recyclers are always a priority target.%0a%3c You can take more time scooping debris if you destroy your opponent's%0a%3c ability to claim it.%0a%3c %0a%3c Advanced Logistics%0a%3c ------------------%0a%3c %0a%3c Keeping the wheels of war turning requires good logistics. Part of that%0a%3c is simply fleet replacement; while you are running amok and taking your%0a%3c opponent's bases, your production queues should be running full bore%0a%3c back home to keep your force levels the same (or to keep them on the%0a%3c rise). If things are going well and you are getting a lot of money from%0a%3c debris, feel free to use Fast Production. You don't want to be sitting%0a%3c on large stacks of cash if you get pillaged in war.%0a%3c %0a%3c >>note%3c%3c%0a%3c Note: It's a common but incorrect belief that you lose money when you%0a%3c get pillaged. You don't. But the amount of cash you have on hand is part%0a%3c of the equation that determines how large the enemy pillage is, and you%0a%3c don't want to give him money if he hits you. Let him work for the debris%0a%3c like everyone else. Don't let him get 20k a pop instantly because you are sitting on too much money)%0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c %0a%3c The trickier part of logistics is resupply. The biggest limiting factor%0a%3c on a fleet's utility is its Fighter supply. I cannot stress to you the%0a%3c ridiculous number of Fighters you will go through in large engagements.%0a%3c I've dropped 6000 Fighters just in one wave before. That's not even%0a%3c counting the Fighters I used in the main fleet. If you are butting heads%0a%3c with large fleets, you will burn through Fighters at a rate that rivals%0a%3c Lindsey Lohan's cocaine consumption. Once you are out of Fighters, your fleet is vulnerable and your ratios are screwed. Rapid resupply is essential to continuing fleet function.%0a%3c %0a%3c The ideal way to keep a fleet functioning is to keep it in supply. Fleet%0a%3c Carriers are essential in combat fleets, with their high survivability%0a%3c saving you tons of credits if you get caught flat-footed. They make poor%0a%3c resupply vessels, though, because they are not as fast. Regular carriers%0a%3c are far easier to kill, but are also 33%25 faster than Fleet Carriers.%0a%3c This makes them ideal as rear echelon units. They are never intended to%0a%3c see combat. The idea is to dispatch your resupply carriers from a%0a%3c jumpgate, drop off their Fighter compliment for the FCs in the field to%0a%3c pick up, and then run them back home. In my opinion, Carriers should%0a%3c only be built for resupply purposes, or for when you need to get more%0a%3c Fighter transport up fast. Fleet Carriers not only have higher%0a%3c survivability, but they also have more hangar space per credit spent%0a%3c than Carriers do---even if it's not by much. Carriers serve a very%0a%3c specific role once you get FCs, and this is it. Keep plenty of Fighters%0a%3c at the jumpgate where the carriers are on standby, and trying to keep%0a%3c enough bombers and heavy bombers on hand to fill your carriers for those%0a%3c instances when your enemy is vulnerable to a bomber or HB drop. Focus on%0a%3c Fighters, though.%0a%3c %0a%3c Sometimes you won't be able to resupply in time, and you've got the%0a%3c enemy breathing down you neck. You may have taken a strategic point that%0a%3c you are not yet willing to vacate, but you are going to get pounded if you%0a%3c stay because you don't have enough meat left in the fleet. This is the%0a%3c other function of Corvettes. Deploying from a decent jumpgate will%0a%3c almost invariably get Corvettes to your wounded fleet in time for battle%0a%3c unless you've already let the enemy sneak up on you. Corvettes aren't as%0a%3c efficient as meat as Fighters are, but their armor-per-credit is equal%0a%3c to bombers. Sometimes Corvettes are the best you can do, but they'll%0a%3c save you thousands in fleet in the long run.%0a%3c %0a%3c In the event that you have a large fleet in a relatively secure galaxy%0a%3c but the neighboring galaxies have a smaller guild presence, you may want%0a%3c to build up a cache of Fighters at a friendly base in the neighboring%0a%3c galaxy so that you have a resupply point for your fleet if you send%0a%3c reinforcements that way during war. This takes a lot of preparation%0a%3c time, and means you'll have one less campaign fleet to work with. Still,%0a%3c it's well worth it if you think you may have reason to send%0a%3c reinforcements to that galaxy in the future. Half the time, you'll eat%0a%3c through most of your Fighter compliment in three or four strikes,%0a%3c leaving your fleet to either make a stand and get crushed for lousy%0a%3c ratios or to head all the way back to your home galaxy to resupply. If%0a%3c you've built up a supply of Fighters beforehand, your fleet will have%0a%3c much greater longevity before it is forced to withdraw.%0a%3c %0a%3c Okay, that's it for now, folks. I'll get to Volume IV in the near%0a%3c future. Pat yourself on the back if you actually read this hulking%0a%3c monstrosity. All questions, comments, threats, random cursing, and%0a%3c name-calling are welcome.  Back to top 	View user's profile Send private%0a%3c message 	 	%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c Okay so the exact change to the combat system is as such. Previously all%0a%3c units would spread out their damage evenly amongst all targets they%0a%3c could do damage too, while only about 1%25 of the damage dealt by a stack%0a%3c would cause damage to each stack of units it could not breech the%0a%3c shields of. Confusing yes, I know. So I give you an example:%0a%3c %0a%3c >>example%3c%3c%0a%3c You have 1000 Fighters and the enemy has 500 Fighters, 300 Corvettes, 4%0a%3c Heavy Cruisers and a set of Disruptor Turrets. Assuming base technology%0a%3c your Fighters would do 2000 points of damage, 20 damage (1%25 of damage)%0a%3c would hit the Disruptors, 20 damage (1%25) would hit the Heavy Cruisers,%0a%3c and 980 damage (49%25) would hit each stack of Fighters and Corvettes.%0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c %0a%3c The change has been made now, that instead of 1%25, 5%25 of damage is sent%0a%3c at each of the unit stacks that Fighters could not otherwise damage.%0a%3c This reduces the effect of Fighter drops because you'll need more%0a%3c Fighters to destroy the same amount of unshielded ships as you%0a%3c previously needed.%0a%3c %0a%3c As a result, I am recommending the building of heavy shielded ships,%0a%3c like Heavy Cruisers and Battleships in your defensive screens, even if%0a%3c you have P-Rings. This will reduce the effectiveness of Fighter drops%0a%3c significantly, as Heavy Cruisers and Battleships will absorb 5x more of%0a%3c the firepower that would otherwise hit your smaller units under the old%0a%3c system. Whether the system is changed back or not is beyond my guess,%0a%3c but for now, this is how it works. Also, take this into account when%0a%3c attacking large stacks of fleet. Fighter drops will be ineffective%0a%3c against planets with multiple layers of defenses (Ions, Photons,%0a%3c Disruptors, D-shields, P-shields, Rings all absorb 5%25 of attack damage%0a%3c now) and heavy and super capital ships.%0a%3c (:comment This page has been edited using Pywe:)%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
