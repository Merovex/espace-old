text=Orbital Bases, Androids Factories, Antimatter Plants and Multi-Level%0aPlatforms all require substantial research to construct. The Advanced%0aBase Guide offers [[AdvancedBaseGuide#buildgoals|build goals]] for free%0aplayers. That is, it shows what a player limited to five terraforms can%0aaccomplish by building on the right astro.  Those goals provide a free%0aplayer with all the structures necessary to have a thriving empire.%0a%0aI was asked to touch on what I call ``Very Advanced Structures." As%0aearlier, I will discuss these structures for the benefit of free%0aplayers. I term them ``Very Advanced" to sub-categorize these from the%0aAdvanced Structures that Astro Empires has.  Advanced Structures are%0athose structures that Astro Empires limits a free player from building.%0aThose structures discussed in the [[Advanced Base Guide]] are essential%0afor a free player to have any real longevity in Astro Empires. %0a%0aVery Advanced Structures are important as a player grows beyond Level 30. I separated them because you really cannot use these structures%0auntil you have the sound foundation offered through the Advanced Base%0aGuide.%0a%0a(:*toc:)%0a%0aAdvice on Structure Use%0a=======================%0a%0aThis section discusses the Very Advanced Structures and how they can be%0abest used for a Free Player.%0a%0aMulti-Level Platforms and Orbital Bases%0a--------------------------------%0a%0aWhen available, these two structures should be built to their limit.%0aOrbital Bases provides berths for 50 spaces. %0aOne might consider this a way to reduce the space used by Urban Structures.%0aHowever, Multi-Level Platforms (MLP) provide 50 spaces.%0aTherefore, rather than using Orbital Bases to free up space on an astro,%0athese structures work with Multi-Level Platforms to provide the base%0awith 50 available spaces.%0a%0aAntimater Plants Do Not Free Up Fusion Plants%0a---------------------------------------------%0a%0aOne might expect that the Antimatter Plants would help free up space on%0athe astro by reducing the need for Fusion Plants. After all, at%0aEnergy-20, an Antimatter Plant provides 20 units of energy. Five Plants%0awould free up 12 Fusion Plants, which only provides the base with seven%0aextra slots. There is a better use for these Plants than freeing up%0aseven slots discussed in the following sub-section.%0a%0aThree Pringles is Enough%0a------------------------%0a%0aPringles is the vernacular for a pair of Planetary Rings and Shields. At%0aLevel-30, players are well advised to have at least one set of Pringles%0aon each base. Two is considered minimal. I would recommend three. Three%0asets of Pringles requires 108 energy, which consumes all the available%0aAntimatter Plants a free player has at his disposal, and requires a%0aFusion Plant. Assuming the free player builds the MLP and Orbital Bases%0aas described above, '''three sets of Pringles require 9 spaces''' on the%0aAstro: none for the Rings, three for the Shields, five for the%0aAntimatter Plants, and one for the Fusion Plant. It would also consume%0a12 of the 50 berths provided by the Orbital Bases.%0a%0aA fourth set would require additional 5 Fusion Plants, consuming 6%0aspaces on the astro and 7 berths. Therefore, from a space and resource%0aperspective, a fourth set consumes fifty percent more resources than the%0afirst three; energy excluded.%0a%0aAndroid Factories%0a-----------------%0a%0aAndroid Factories are also very useful. All five factories provide 30%0aconstruction and production. They require three Fusion Plants, and consume%0aeight berths on the Orbital Bases and eight spaces on the astro.%0a%0aOrbital Shipyards%0a-----------------%0a%0aAre Orbital Shipyards essential? I include them in this discussion%0abecause they require advanced research. Astro Empires does not limit the%0afree player in building these structures. Why? Because these structures%0aallow a player to build the Capital ships, and you need seven to build a%0aDeath Star. %0a%0aI champion the [[Small Fleet Doctrine]]. That Doctrine holds that%0aCapital ships are unnecessary.  The only possible exception is the%0aproduction of Dreadnaughts, which work well with Planetary Rings in%0amaking a base an inefficent target.  However, a few Battleships%0aaccomplish the same task while complying with the Doctrine. Therefore,%0aif you comply dogmatically to this Doctrine, you may not need an Orbital%0aShipyard.  %0a%0aA reader asserted the paragraph above was a bit short-sighted.  After%0aall, an Orbital Shipyard takes up no space. It draws 12 energy and a%0asingle berth. If you are using Fusion Plants to power it, then three%0atotal berths are consumed, with four energy remaining; or two of them%0aconsume 5 total berths. An Orbital Shipyard provides an additional 9%0aproduction (remember it requires Cybernetics-2, which boosts baseline%0aproduction), which would require five spaces, and a Fusion Plant;%0aconsuming 6 berths. Two Orbital Shipyards, consuming five berths,%0aprovide as much production as 9 Shipyards, which requires 11 slots and%0aberths.%0a%0aThis taken into account, there is value in building Orbital Shipyards%0afor the sole purpose of boosting Production. You should let your total%0aplan for a base guide you.%0a%0aBiosphere Modification: Too Little, Too Late%0a--------------------------------------------%0a%0aBiosphere Modification is similar to Orbital Shipyards as Astro Empires%0adoes not limit its construction by Free Players.  This only affects%0aUrban Structures, however, as Orbital Bases are not affected by an%0aastro's fertility. Is this a big deal? I contend they are not.%0a%0aFor a Slot-2 Arid fully Terraformed, one level of Biosphere Modification%0afrees two or three Urban Structures at most. Arid'_2_' astros have a Fertility%0aof 6. A Minimal base has Urban Structures-12, with the Research bases%0ahaving Urban Structures-17; providing berths for 60 and 102 spaces,%0arespectively. Raising the Fertility to 7 means those Structures provide%0a72 and 119 berths. %0a%0aAs discussed above, Orbital Bases work with Multi-Level Platforms.%0aTherefore, extending the Fertility does not impact the additional space%0aoffered by MLPs. Therefore, the Modification lets the base owner retire%0aextra Urban Structures. Now, the Research base only needs Urban%0aStructures-15, which frees up '''''two''''' Structures. At Biosphere%0aModification-2, the astro now needs Urban Structures-13. Bioshpere%0aModification-3 means that base now needs Urban Structures-12! Three%0amodifications on a Fertility-6 astro allows you to free up five slots.%0a%0aThe first level costs 20,000 credits. As I don't have the cost of higher%0alevels, each next level should cost 50 percent more than the last. So,%0aLevel-2 costs 30,000, and the Level-3 costs 45,000.  For a total%0aexpenditure of 95,000 credits, a free player can retire five Urban%0aStructures---a cost of 19,000 per Structure retired.%0a%0aBuild Suggestions%0a=================%0a%0aLet us assume you've followed the suggestion of this guide. You, the%0afree player, have built three sets of Pringles and maxed out the%0aAndroids Factories. This consumes 17 spaces on the Astro---two MLPs.%0aThis consumes the power generated by all five of your Antimatter Plants%0aand four Fusion Plants. This table below summarizes the impact of these%0abuilding decisions, but reflects that you have a 42 spaces remaining, 39%0aberths and four energy.%0a%0a(:table cellspacing=0 class=structure:)%0a(:cellnr class=heading:)&nbsp;%0a(:cell class=heading:) Space%0a(:cell class=heading:) Berth%0a(:cell class=heading:) Energy%0a(:cellnr :)'''Multi-Level Platforms'''%0a(:cell align=right:)+50%0a(:cell align=right:)-%0a(:cell align=right:)-%0a(:cellnr :)'''Orbital Bases'''%0a(:cell align=right:)-%0a(:cell align=right:)+50%0a(:cell align=right:)-%0a(:cellnr :)'''Antimatter Plants'''%0a(:cell align=right:)5%0a(:cell align=right:)5%0a(:cell align=right:)+100%0a(:cellnr :)'''Fusion Plants'''%0a(:cell align=right:)4%0a(:cell align=right:)4%0a(:cell align=right:)+32%0a(:cellnr :)'''Pringles (3)'''%0a(:cell align=right:)3%0a(:cell align=right:)6%0a(:cell align=right:)108%0a(:cellnr :)'''Android Factories'''%0a(:cell align=right:)5%0a(:cell align=right:)5%0a(:cell align=right:)20%0a(:cellnr :)'''Remaining'''%0a(:cell align=right:)33%0a(:cell align=right:)30%0a(:cell align=right:)4%0a(:tableend:)%0a%0a>>info%3c%3c%0aLet me let you in on a bit of a secret. How many Urban Structures are%0aneeded to berth an astro? The answer is number of slots available%0adivided by one more than the fertility:%0a%0aUS = Available / (Fertility + 1)%0a%0aThis is because the Urban Structures themselves consume a space. Try it!%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0aWhat do we do with the remaining spaces? You can (for the space):%0a%0a* (25) Make a Production base a full Production/Research base. Building Labs-22 consumes 25 spaces and berths after including the energy.%0a* (2) Add Jumpgates, which requires one Fusion Plant and consumes 2 berths and spaces per level. By adding one Urban Structure, you can add JG-3 to any base.%0a* (11) Increase to Command Center-20, costing 11 berths and requiring one Fusion Plant.%0a* (6-12) Increase to Spaceport-20, costing 5-10 berths and 1 or two Fusion Plants%0a* (12) Increase your Metal Refinery and Robotics Factories to 22 and 18 respectively, which ``balances" these structures with the Androids Factories-5 and consumes 12 more energy and berths (one more Fusion Plant after the Remaining above), and increases your base economy by 12 (to 60 based on your trade routes).%0a%0aFinal Observation%0a=================%0a%0aI offer a suggestion for free players. It costs 3 USD per month to%0aupgrade an account. If you really want to get more from this game, then%0amaximize your construction of all the limited strucutres; build your%0aPringles and fully develop the bases within the limits of your free%0aaccount. Save as many credits as you can.  Then, upgrade for one month%0aand spend every spare moment of that month building the structures%0abeyond the limits. Build Terraform-10, Nanite-11, etc. %0a%0aBetter yet, '''build more bases'''. By growing from 9 to 10 bases, you%0aincrease your empire's potential by 11 percent. For each additional%0abase, the returns diminish; the percentage return is 20 minus the number%0aof bases. So, from 9 to 10 bases, you have an 11 percent return; 10 to%0a11 has ten percent; 11 to 12 has 9 percent, etc. Spending a month to%0abuild from 9 to 12 bases, however, increases your empire by 30 percent.%0aIs that worth 3 USD? Having the money saved and Outpost Ships ready at%0athe beginning of the paid-for month is the best way to maximize your%0a``Free" empire's potential.%0a%0a[[!Sidebar]]%0a%0a(:comment This page has been edited using Pywe:)%0a(:title Very Advanced Structures:)
