text=(:*toc:)%0a%0a>>warn%3c%3c%0aUnder revision I'm working my way from top to bottom. The net%0aconclusions are the same, the supporting data is skewed.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0aAssumptions%0a===========%0a%0aMy analysis makes the following assumptions. This analysis assumes a%0amoderately advanced account, which I believe helps newer accounts plan%0awhat they will need for space planning a few months out.%0a%0a* Energy-20 (i.e., double energy output)%0a* Free account limitations (Five of the following: Terraform, Fusion Plants, Antimatter Plants, Nanite Factories, Android Factories.)%0a* Good defenses comprise Pring-15, Pshield-10, and CC-5.%0a%0aFollowing these assumptions, we know:%0a%0a* Astro area is increased by 25 for the Terraforms.%0a* Advanced Plants consume 10 spaces and berths, and provide 200 energy%0a* Advanced Factories consume 10 spaces and berths, and 60 energy%0a* Good defenses consume 7 spaces, 10 berths, and 109 energy%0a* Net difference is -2 spaces, -30 berths and +31 energy%0a%0aWhy does this matter? Beyond these ``constants," we have to consider%0aSpaceports, Shipyards, Labs and construction infrastructure. Small Fleet%0aencourages 12 to 16 Shipyards per base (you'll need Dreads for base%0adefense, which is 20 Shipyards and an Orbital Shipyard). %0a%0aTerms Used%0a==========%0a%0a* '''Slot''' is the orbit of an astro.%0a* '''Berth''' is a unit of population consumed.%0a* '''Space''' is a unit of astro area consumed.%0a%0aSpace Available %0a==============%0a%0aThe tables below show the amount of space available after applying the%0aassumptions above. Two spaces have been removed due to less space. The%0abonus in energy and loss in berths are assumed to balance out...so I'm%0aleaving them out. In reality, the energy bonus benefits Slot-2 astros%0aacross the board by mitigating the difference in lost solar power.%0a%0aThe ``U" shows the number of Urbans required. The ``P" shows the number of%0aSolar (or Gas) Plants. The fourth column (Slot-2,3(F)) denotes only%0afusion plants, which is available to Upgraded players in sufficient numbers and conveys the%0abenefit of increased fertility without the loss of Solar.%0a%0aPlanets%0a-------%0a%0a|| class=structure cellspacing=0%0a||!

This shows the area minus the required number of Urbans to%0asupport the remaining area, not after plants.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0aThe charts below show the remaining available space for each astro type.%0aAvailable space is calculated by the total space minus the space%0arequired for Urban Structures and Fusion/Gas/Solar Plants. The first%0achart shows the moon space available. %0a%0aWe have two considerations to make. Upgraded players are advised to%0abuild on moons because the smaller size makes building P-Rings and%0aP-Shields (i.e., Pringles) cheaper. Generally speaking, the difference%0abetween a Moon and Planet in usable space is within two Terraform%0alevels, which is significantly less expensive than the difference in%0aPringle costs.%0a%0aMoons%0a-----%0a%0aThe general advice has been to take a Slot 1 over Slot 2 moon. This is%0abecause of the increased Energy of the Slot 1. However, the table%0areveals the difference to be slight to non-existant. In the case of%0aMetal-3 astros, the preference should be Slot-2.%0a%0aIf you eventually replace all Solar Plants with Fusion, you will only%0again two spaces, limiting the value of Fusion Plants when considered%0awith their cost.  Because the Fusion Plant column assumes unlimited%0aupgrades, the value of an all-Fusion planet is not available to free%0aplayers. This is an issue for Moons and Planets.%0a%0aArid and Tundras are generally preferred as research bases, and they are%0aslightly larger than Gaias. This means Gaias are not the holy grail that%0ais widely touted. Toxic Moons compete with Earthly, which means they%0ashould be considered when in Slot 4 and 5.%0a%0a(:bburl #moons:)%0a|| class=structure cellspacing=0%0a||! Astro Type      ||!  Slot 1 ||!

I suggest%0aspending a bit of money to upgrade your account for one month and%0abuilding two extra Terraforms on Moons instead, which will give you the%0ageneral low cost of a Free account with the cost advantage of moons and%0athe space of planets. %0a%0aAs with Moons, the available space difference between Slot 1 and Slot 2%0ais again slight; but Slot 2 is preferred. As with Moons, Metallic astros%0abear the greatest difference. This is due largely to their normal%0aFertility and size.%0a%0a|| class=structure cellspacing=0%0a||! Astro Type      ||! Slot 1   ||!

They are also cheaper than Fusion Plants, which should allow you to absorb the minor loss in space.:)%0a> Slot 2 orbits also increase base Fertility by one, which reduces the%0a> infrastructure you need to build your base.(:footnote Slot 3 orbits also have a boost to fertility, but the loss in solar energy (2 instead of 3) makes Slot 3 a poor choice:)%0a> This easy access to cheap energy and improved fertility is what makes Slot 2 orbits preferable.%0a> Slot 1 orbits are the second preference because they have higher solar%0a> energy but less %0a> fertility.(:footnote The trade-off may not be aparent at first.  When you research Energy-3, your Solar Plants will produce one more energy.  This means energy deficits are easier to remedy than population deficits, which makes Slot 2 the better choice.:)%0a> Slot 3 and beyond are terrible choices as you are always in a deficit in%0a> either energy or fertility.%0a> %0a> Choosing a Moon or Planet%0a> ------------------------%0a> %0a> Should you choose a moon or a planet? If you are going to play with a%0a> free account, you should focus on planets. Otherwise, you should focus%0a> on moons. This is because of limitations of space. Free players are%0a> limited to five terraform structures. This puts a ceiling on the number%0a> of structures they can build. Therefore, free players need the larger%0a> astros to maximize what they can build.%0a> %0a> Conversely, upgraded players have no ceiling on structures. This allows%0a> paying characters to focus on other issues; such as cost. Planetary%0a> Shields, Deflection Shields and Planetary Rings cost 25 percent less on%0a> Moons than Planets. That is a gross savings of 1024, 6250 and 12500%0a> credits, respectively. The size difference between a Moon and Planet is%0a> usually surmounted by two Terraforming, which costs 192 credits. Thus,%0a> it is cheaper to occupy Moons in the long term for upgraded players.%0a> %0a> At least, this is the traditional logic. I need to look into this%0a> further to determine if there is real cost savings.%0a

Because space is a premium on all astros, it is%0a%3c critical that you build your empire by specializing your astros%0a%3c accordingly. All bases should have a minimum structure, but%0a%3c specialization helps a given base reach its potential. This section%0a%3c discusses basic empire organization and specific base structures.%0a%3c %0a%3c Basic Empire Organization%0a%3c -------------------------%0a%3c %0a%3c For a basic empire, you will want three %0a%3c Commerce(:footnote Most guides call these ``economy" astros. I prefer to call the ``commerce" because I have a symbol for commerce I use.:) %0a%3c astros, two Research Astros, three%0a%3c Production astros, and a balance of Production/Research astros%0a%3c (dual-purpose).  Your first will likely be a dual Production/Research%0a%3c base, this arrangement provides ten bases---the goal of %0a%3c [the Ten-Seven Guide](TheTenSevenGuide). When building your initial empire,%0a%3c your second, third and fourth bases should be commerce specialized to%0a%3c help jump start your economy. The table below suggests an order in which%0a%3c you may build your bases.%0a%3c %0a%3c || cellspacing=0 class=structure%0a%3c ||! Base ||!

In [[the Ten Seven Guide]], you are advised to start with a Rocky, Crater or Metallic%0a%3c planet; to optimize production. These three astros are suited for%0a%3c Production, yet you have to build eight Research Labs to expand your%0a%3c bases. Rather than later disband those Labs (recovering only half of%0a%3c what you spent), the recommendation is that you make your first base%0a%3c dual-purpose.%0a%3c %0a%3c However, if you decide to take a bit of a chance (as I did in [[a Ten Seven Diary]]) by taking a base that is recommended for Research, then%0a%3c your first base can be one of your pure Research bases. The reason why a%0a%3c preferred-research astro does not need to become dual-purpose is because%0a%3c all bases need a minimum number of Shipyards, and those constructed to%0a%3c expand your empire fit within that minimum.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Base Structure Goals%0a%3c --------------------%0a%3c %0a%3c A major consideration is specializing astros and optimizing production,%0a%3c commerce and research.

This section%0a%3c discusses the three considerations in astro selection.%0a%3c %0a%3c Astro Specialization and Type%0a%3c -----------------------------%0a%3c %0a%3c These are good pros and cons for each type of astro. The%0a%3c general consensus for astro choices are the following:%0a%3c %0a%3c Each astro has different advantages that make them better for certain%0a%3c specializations. The general consensus on Astro Empires is to specialize%0a%3c the astros below. If the astro is not below, do not waste your time.

When astro hunting, always make a note of%0a%3c Crystalline, Gaia and Rocky astros. If you do  not plant a base there,%0a%3c somebody will. There are a lot of Asteroids, otherwise I would recommend%0a%3c charting them, too.%0a%3c %0a%3c Free account players should add 25 to the astro's area to represent the%0a%3c maximum possible space they will have available with terraforming. Once%0a%3c you research Armour-22, you should add another 50 to the astro's area to%0a%3c represent the limits you will encounter with Multilevel Platforms. Thus,%0a%3c an Asteroid will never have more than 140 spaces for structures.%0a%3c %0a%3c Impact of Orbit/Fertility on Area%0a%3c ---------------------------------%0a%3c %0a%3c The following table shows how many Urban Structures you need for a given%0a%3c astro type.

They are also cheaper than Fusion Plants, which should allow you to absorb the minor loss in space.:)%0a%3c Slot 2 orbits also increase base Fertility by one, which reduces the%0a%3c infrastructure you need to build your base.(:footnote Slot 3 orbits also have a boost to fertility, but the loss in solar energy (2 instead of 3) makes Slot 3 a poor choice:)%0a%3c This easy access to cheap energy and improved fertility is what makes Slot 2 orbits preferable.%0a%3c Slot 1 orbits are the second preference because they have higher solar%0a%3c energy but less %0a%3c fertility.(:footnote The trade-off may not be aparent at first.  When you research Energy-3, your Solar Plants will produce one more energy.  This means energy deficits are easier to remedy than population deficits, which makes Slot 2 the better choice.:)%0a%3c Slot 3 and beyond are terrible choices as you are always in a deficit in%0a%3c either energy or fertility.%0a%3c %0a%3c Choosing a Moon or Planet%0a%3c ------------------------%0a%3c %0a%3c Should you choose a moon or a planet? If you are going to play with a%0a%3c free account, you should focus on planets. Otherwise, you should focus%0a%3c on moons. This is because of limitations of space. Free players are%0a%3c limited to five terraform structures. This puts a ceiling on the number%0a%3c of structures they can build. Therefore, free players need the larger%0a%3c astros to maximize what they can build.%0a%3c %0a%3c Conversely, upgraded players have no ceiling on structures. This allows%0a%3c paying characters to focus on other issues; such as cost. Planetary%0a%3c Shields, Deflection Shields and Planetary Rings cost 25 percent less on%0a%3c Moons than Planets. That is a gross savings of 1024, 6250 and 12500%0a%3c credits, respectively. The size difference between a Moon and Planet is%0a%3c usually surmounted by two Terraforming, which costs 192 credits. Thus,%0a%3c it is cheaper to occupy Moons in the long term for upgraded players.%0a%3c %0a%3c At least, this is the traditional logic. I need to look into this%0a%3c further to determine if there is real cost savings.%0a%3c %0a%3c [[!Sidebar]]%0a%3c (:comment This page has been edited using Pywe:)%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
