This keeps local issues within the System Courts of Cassation.%0a%0aThe Imperium Courts have an odd mix of civil and common law. An attempt by the Emperor and [[Imperial Congress]] to legislate every issue and thus preempt common law has only served to strengthen the role of common law.

Custom was determined by treaties between systems as well as common practices found among a majority of the more developed star systems.
