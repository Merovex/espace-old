text=What is the best way to calculate a unit's efficiency? There is a simple%0aformula that helps a player calculate the ratio of units needed in an%0aattack:%0a%0a>>formula%3c%3c%0aRatio = (Power'_Attacker_' - Shield'_Defender_') / Armour'_Defender_'%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0aThis is a clean formula. You have to adjust for the technology level of%0athe attacker and defender, but the result is how many attacking units%0aare necessary to defeat the enemy in one attack. Against base defenses,%0ayou have to remember to multiply by five. You also have to remember to%0ahalve the value of the Shield when dealing with Ions.%0a%0a>>formula%3c%3c%0aBase Defenses on the Attack:%0a%0aRatio = (Power'_Attacker_' - Shield'_Defender_') * 5 / Armour'_Defender_'%0a%0aBase Defenses on the Defense:%0a%0aRatio = (Power'_Attacker_' - Shield'_Defender_') / (Armour'_Defender_' * 5)%0a%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0aThere is another way to approach this. The formula below shows the%0acost per unit of power delivered against a given target.%0a%0a>>formula%3c%3c%0aCost = Cost'_Attacker_' / (Power'_Attacker_' - Shield'_Defender_') %0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0aAs an example, Let's try a Battleship against a Titan.
