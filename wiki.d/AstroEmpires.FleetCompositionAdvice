text=This guide provides specific advice on fleet formation based on the%0a[[Small Fleet Doctrine]]. The assumption is you want a solid core fleet,%0athe ability to add specialty fleet, and the Recyclers necessary to%0aharvest the derbs quickly. Practically, a speciality fleet is hunting%0aCapitals.%0a%0aCore Fleet%0a==========%0a%0aThe Core Fleet comprises the bulk of one's fleet. Fighters and Cruisers%0aare kept to the same ratio. That is, you'll need forty Fighters per%0aCruiser. To carry all the Fighters you'll need Carriers or Frigates. %0a%0a* 400 FTs with 10 Cruisers require 12 Carriers (4,000 combat, 4,800 in Carriers) or%0a* 400 FTs with 10 Cruisers require 90 Frigates (11,200 combat, 7,200 in Frigates)%0a%0aThe disadvantage of Cruisers is their modest vulnerability to Fighters.%0aAs this is due to their low shields, your goal to combat this is to push%0ayour shield research when possible. For example, if your opponent's%0aLaser is at 25 and your Shield is at 18 and your Armour is at 22, your%0aopponent needs 56 FTs to kill your Cruiser.%0a%0aCapital Hunting Fleet%0a=====================%0a%0aWhat are you hunting? Cruisers are efficient against Heavy Cruisers and%0aBattleships; and are efficient in cracking all Base Defenses. So,  we%0aare really discussing attacks on Capital units (Dreads, Titans and%0aLevis). If you're going after the most efficient, you want Ion Frigates.%0aIf you're looking for the most general (but still efficient), you want%0aBattleships. While Ion Frigates cost slightly more, they encounter fewer%0alosses. Both Battleships and Ion Frigates become more lethal with higher%0aresearch in Ion.%0a%0a* Ion Frigates%0a** Dreads: ~100 to 120 Ion Frigates to the Dread (13Kcr)%0a** Titans: ~400 to 480 Ion Frigates to the Titan (53Kcr)%0a** Levis: ~1300 to 1350 Ion Frigates to the Levi (160Kcr)%0a* Battleships%0a** Dreads: ~5 Battleships to the Dread (10Kcr)%0a** Titans: ~20 Battleships to the Titan (40Kcr)%0a** Levis: ~70 Battleships to the Dread (140Kcr)%0a%0aI still recommend avoiding Ion Bombers, but they are more efficient than%0aBattleships against Capitals. Your choice.%0a%0aRecyclers%0a=========%0a%0aThe easiest rule of thumb is to carry 1 Recycler for every 10 credits of%0acombat fleet. That can be a huge number of Recyclers. However, this lets%0ayou harvest all fleet derbs (yours and your victim's) in one tick.%0a%0a(:comment This page has been edited using Pywe:)
