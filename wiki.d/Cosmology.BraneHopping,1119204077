Brane-Hopping< < Brane-Hopping is a term commonly used to describe macrospace travel as the technology behind it is commonly thought to be an application of theories involving String/Brane theory. Essentially, our Universe floats on a "brane," much like a piece of paper or cloth could float suspended in water. By leaving the brane, ships can shorten apparent travel times by hopping from one fold to the next.< < !! Astrogation Mechanics< < Essentially, macrospace travel requires precise calculations and timing that allow a ship to hop the folds. Consequently, astrogating a hop cannot be done manually, only dedicated computers are capable of course plotting. Known routes are easier to compute due to their predictability.< < The route taken in Branespace is not the same as in Realspace, because the route in Branespace is an optimized hopping of folds of the Brane. This may mean that the shortest route from Sol to Alpha Centauri may take one past Beetlegeuse. Perhaps it is easier to explain that Brane-hopping is similar in some ways to skipping a stone: the route may spend time where it cannot _just_ re-enter Realspace; and where the skips are not necessarily linear in Realspace.< < Each route has a given difficulty. This is determined by the influence of gravity bodies along the route (as determined by hyperspace, not necessarily realspace). The vessel's astrogation computer must contend with this difficulty when plotting a course. As [[Technology/Computers |computers]] are computational capacity governed by their time period, earlier travel is significantly more difficult and error prone.< < !!! Inital Route Plotting:< < Additionally, there is immense risk that an uncalculated Brane-hop will send the vessel deep into the Soup, never to be seen again. To mitigate this, massive Brane-computers on the major colonies and Sol calculate probable safe routes. When a high degree of certainty of a route is determined, then a scout ship (manned or unmanned) is given the route forumla and then attempts the route. The accuracy of the route is then fed back into the Brane-computers. When a route is established, then trip reports are routinely fed back into the Brane-computers, which improves future calculations for that route (hopefully), and help to develop new routes.< < There is one wrinkle in this: sometimes manned missions either do not report back, or provide falsified information. This may be because a high-value route has been found and the crew believe they can profit from it. Alternatively, they could mis-report a bad route with a similar intent to profit.< < !!! Route Difficulty: < For a given period (e.g. FirstExpanse) a route has a set "general difficulty." This is a guideline the GM should consider when determining the difficulty the vessel will have in successfully astrogating to its destination. As mentioned below, varying factors may change this default to a "local difficulty," such as a higher difficulty due to hyperspace perturbations.< < !! Astrogation Issues< < Brane-Hopping is not without peril. There are three conditions that may be influenced by the quality of the plot: time, location, and emergence. A GM is free to fudge which condition is affected, or may roll dF and let the die suggest a condition. (For Example, '-' could be time, '+' could be location, and ' ' could be emergence).< < !!! Time:< < Normally, a successful hop travels roughtly 0.1 lyd (light years per day), making the 4.1 ly trip to Alpha Centauri last 41 days. An extremely successful plot could shorten the trip, but a failed plot could delay the trip significantly.< < !!! Location:< < A successful plot should land the vessel near the intended target, perhaps within 1 AU of the intended location. Extremely successful plots could land precisely where targetd, and a failed hop-plot could cause the vessel to miss by tens of AU.< < !!! Emergence: < Vessels do not typically snap immediately from Real Space to hyperspace. Instead, there is a fading period when the ship switches to the 'gaining space.' The normal period of a fade is about an hour, but the quality of the plot may influence this. An extremely successful plot could shorten the fade period to mere minute. A poor plot could result in a long fade, or into a ghost condition. This bane of Brane Hopping, a ghost condition is where the vessel fades partly into the gaining space, but never fully enters. Instead, it is locked in place.< < !!! Technological Influences:< < As mentioned above, computer capacity is capped by time period. So, for example, an astrogation computer during the FirstExpanse is limited to a computational power of Poor. This naturally limits the possible routes that a computer may consistently plot. By the period of the FirstContact, computational power may be capped at Good. This opens up routes considered hazardous in previous generations, and may result in faster travel times (or more accurate destination plotting) of earlier, less hazardous routes. As an example, the earlier mentioned AC<->Sol route, generally Poor in difficulty, would be much easier to manage in the FirstContact than in the FirstExpanse< < !! Hyperspace Perturbations< < One little known side effect of Brane-Hopping is hyperspace perturbations. Commonly called vertices or storms, these perturbations are caused by overuse of a given route. Too many ships over too short a time cause local changes to a given routes difficulty. So, if the route AC<->Sol normally requires a Poor plot, but recently many ships have passed along that route, the same route may start needing a Mediocre plot to succeed. This has frequently led to problems were a route has been used so much that it must be abandoned for a long time. This effect is likely due to problems in the technology used to Brane-Hop, which may account for why future technological improvements mitigate these perturbations.< < -- Guide.AmeenDausha - 09 Mar 2004 <br />< -- Updated Guide.AmeenDausha - 13 Jul 2004 <br />\ No newline at end of file

Briefly described, our Universe is a "brane" (short for membrane) that floats in multi-dimensional space (called "Soup"). An ideal way of visualizing this is to picture a piece of cloth floating in water, or the egg in Egg Drop soup.  [[Main/Dictionary#Branespace |Branespace]] allows a vessel to shorten travel by "hopping" from one brane wrinkle to the other.< < Distance is an impractical measuring tool when travelling through hyperspace. Realspace linear distance between two stars cannot compare to their relative orientation in the Soup. A more suitable tool for measuring is time. That is, trips are typically described in how long it typically takes to travel an optimized route between two [[Main/Dictionary#Loci|loci]].< < Speed is likewise a difficult unit to measure. Two loci may be thousands of light years apart and yet be only a few weeks away through the Soup.  Alternatively, two loci may be close, only a few dozen light years apart, and still take months to travel. Likewise, a well calculate route may reduce the normal hop time.< < !! The Mechanics of Brane-Hopping< < Most hops occur along documented and optimzied routes between two loci.  A route is a path that cuts through the Soup. There are periods during a hop where a vessel cannot re-enter Realspace. While a route may be well known, there are ever-present fluctuations that make plotting a route impossible for most organic sentient beings.< < Soup travel requires precision timing and interactions within the vessel and its immediate surrounding space. Due to this complexity, dedicated shipboard super-computers are required to manage all aspects of the Hop.  When traveling along a known route, the hop-computer takes the baseline data from the [[Main/Dictionary#Route Profile|route profile]] and compensates for varying local changes by applying various formulae. The effeciency by which computers are capable of processing a local hop vary throughout E-space history.< < Route profiles are typically stored on planet-side computers controlled by governments and major [[Main/Dictionary#NGO|NGOs]. These organizations seek to track every route between all known loci. Ship computers cannot carry all known routes because of the amount of storage route profiles require. Additionally, route profiles are continually being updated by other vessels. Therefore, a route profile becomes stale over time as more vessels traverse that route and time progresses.< < The birth of a new route is a dangerous one. Specialized mega-computers calculate the possibility of routes and crunch a possibile route profile. An unmanned route scout vessel determines the route's accuracy by traveling the route. After a successful unmanned scout mission, a manned scout mission follows. Initial routes may be unstable and unpredictable, so while early missions may be successful, the route may deteriorate so quickly that subsequent missions end in abject failure.  Only after scores of successful hops is a route profile declared stable.< < There is one wrinkle in this: sometimes manned missions either do not report back, or provide falsified information. Motivations for doing so are legion. A crew may have discovered a highly valuable route and want to profit from it, or they may have infiltrated the scout group to steal a valuable route to another group. Additionally, they may report a fruitless route due to similar motives.< < While a route may be stable, it may still be a difficult route to travel. Factors contributing to difficulty of a route include a locus' location within a gravity well, gravity bodies along the route--determined by the Soup and not Realspace; and "hop-pollution."< < !! Environmental Factors Influencing Soup Hops< < Travel across the Brane into the Soup requires the use of gravitons. A locus' proximity to a gravity body increases the difficulty of initiating the hop. It may be described by saying that a vessel is like a hot-air balloon that "fills up" on gravitons. Localized gravatonic pressure may make this process more difficult. A strong gravity body along the route (especially black holes) may also upheave the gravatonic bouyancy causing a vessel to return to Realspace prematurely--with a possibility of not being able to resume travel along that route.< < Hop-pollution describes the effect of too much travel along a route. As vessels hop along a route, they bleed off gravitons. How effective they are at controling this is depends on the era. As a result, over-use of a route may increase the gravitons along that route. This has a similar effect as a strong gravity body along the route--the ship may be pushed out of the Soup altogether. This phenomena has made some routes very dangerous to travel, having the effect of closing a once-stable route.  Over time, the pollution may dissipate, reopening the route.< < During a given period (e.g. First Expanse) a route is described as having a general difficulty. The varying factors discussed above will affect that route to give it a local difficulty for a given hop. This is discussed below.< < !! Outcome States and Hop-plotting< < Technology is likewise an influencial factor in a hop. At different periods, technology has varying capability in coping with the various environmental factors mentioned above. Computers have their limitations, and the quality of a hop-plot and local difficulty influences three "outcome states:" time, location and emergence. (In role-playing terms, the GM is either free to determine this, or roll a die to randomize a state. For example, using a Fudge die, '-' could be time, '+' could be location, and ' ' could be emergence.)< ---> Brane-Hopping is a term commonly used to describe macrospace travel as the technology behind it is commonly thought to be an application of theories involving String/Brane theory.

A successful plot will fit within the bounds of that time. A very successful plot may reduce the trip time, while a failed plot may drastically lengthen the trip. Van Winkle ships describe ships that had a terrible plot that caused them to arrive years if not decades after they began the hop.< < There is still debate regarding the effects of time when in the Soup.  Some studies suggest that those who travel the Soup age slower or longer than they would in Realspace.
