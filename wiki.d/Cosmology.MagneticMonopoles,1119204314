This particle would have either a North or South magetic charge, but not an electric charge. I imagine they would have mass of slightly less than a proton (if that matters to anyone.)< < Finding one would be like finding a N end of a magnet without finding a S end. They would be attracted to magnetic fields of the opposite flavor and can be manipulated by using electromagnetic fields.< < Additionally, a N and S monopole could pair up and form a bizarre atom which I have dubbed Magnetium. Magnetium could weakly bond with other substances whose molecular or atomic structure provides for something physicists would call a "magnetic moment." Which just means that part of the molecule has slightly magnetic. (This is not uncommon at all.) < < ---+++ What do they do? Why are they valuable?< < There are a few really important uses for magnetic monopoles:< < ---++++ Fusion Reactors< < Monopoles allow you to build a really strong magnetic field that can easily be manipulated to fire up the plasma reaction for a fusion generator and contain the plasma. < < ---++++ Ramscoop Drives< < Similarly, monopoles provide you with an easy way to funnel and accelerate particles in a ramscoop drive. This increases the efficiency of such drives greatly.< < ---++++ FTL Travel: HyperSpace< < Through a generally unspecified means. Monopoles are essential for the mechanism that allows brane-hopping.< < ---+++ How do they fit in the timeline?< < Monopoles were _officially_ discovered early in the FirstExpanse, but it took until the middle of that period for them to really take off as a critical resource. Some conspiracy theorists suspect that they were discovered earlier, but were kept a corporate secret. < < The popularization of the brane-hopping drive lead to a "monopole rush" of smaller prospecting ships zipping out as far as they dared to other stars in search of bountiful asteroid belts. < < -- [[~JohnUghrin]] - 15 Apr 2004
