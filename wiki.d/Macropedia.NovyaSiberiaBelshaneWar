text=%3c%3c|ImperiumEditionIndex|>>%0a%0aThe '''Novya Siberian-Belshani War''' was a rather minor war with significant results. Novya Siberia was a staunchly independent system that had not kept up with the same technological advances as some of the other systems. In a similar situation was the [[StarSystems/Belshane]]. Both were technologically inferior to many of the other systems, but roughly equal in power.%0a%0aQuite clearly, the Belshane wanted to extend their power base. With the Macropedia/TerranRepublic forming, the chance to do so was beginning to dwindle. They sent several warships to the StarSystems/NovyaSiberia System and demanded surrender. Macropedia/VeltraneFresVolon led the Novya-Siberians at the time, and has been called one of the most dynamic and hard-headed leaders in their history. Even without a significant battle fleet of his own, he responded to the threat with a surprise attack that met with outstanding results.%0a%0aOver the next few years, each side launched attacks against the other, slowly destroying their economies. With one exception, the Battle of Belshani-Yassa, the Belshani lost every significant military engagement. Consequently, most of their efforts focused on attacking intra-system travel within StarSystems/NovyaSiberia. The Siberians in-turn adopted convey tactics to thwart the commerce raiders.%0a%0aEventually, the two sides had pummelled one another to near ruin. The two sides entered into a cease fire. Macropedia/VeltraneFresVolon, who denigrated the Terran Republic then turned to that Republic for security. The Belshane Clans refused to enter the Republic as a result. However, Republican enthusiasts within the common ranks protested and staged strikes until the Clans relented. As if to underscore the shame of the union, the Republic formally admitted [[StarSystems/Belshane]] exactly five years after admitting StarSystems/NovyaSiberia.%0a%0a!!
