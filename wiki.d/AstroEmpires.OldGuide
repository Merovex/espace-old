text=%0aANCIENT Introduction%0a============%0a%0aNice to meet you and I am happy that you decided to join the Galactic Protection Agency Academy (GPAA)!!! The following information has been compiled through talking to all of the upper ranked players and through frequently asked questions to assist you in quickly understanding this game and how to make the right moves early on. The leadership of the GPAA has one goal and one goal only: To facilitate your success.%0a%0aLets start with the basics:%0a%0aBasic Game Dynamics:%0a1) This is an economic game. Economy is the way to go. Power is wealth.%0a%0a2) You cannot ever pass control of a base from one player to another via conquest or gift. This also means you can not pass credits to other players too.%0a%0a3) You can occupy a base and pillage it. This yields credits, and diminishes the production and building capabilities of the owner.%0a%0aThere is a “Newbie” guide that walks you through the initial steps of building your empire. It is located at http://forum.astroempires.com/viewtopic.php?t=11626%0a%0aThis is a great guide and following it will enable you to develop several hundred econ an hour quite quickly. Please follow this guild. Only a few things need to be changed. By the forth day make sure your planets go up to 10 spaceports. The extra trade route per planet is worth the extra money dished out. In addition to this guide I would like to share with you some insight on your first couple of days of playing.%0a%0aFundamentals to Know:%0a%0a1) You are protected for 7 days from attack.%0a%0a2) You will not be attacked or lose your home base during this time.%0a%0a3) Focus on the starter guide for building up your starting base. Always refer to this until you reach your 10th planet.%0a%0a4) Focus on (:abbr ROI Return on Investment:) when selecting what to build and in what order. Choose the build option that generates the most income for the least amount of expenditure. This means switch building types as you progress. Do not build the same structure 5 times in a row. Alternate. Speed is important in the beginning not the level of the structure. Look for economic worlds for your first three colonized bases. The limiting factor mid-to-late game is space and fertility. Asteroids are great short-term revenue makers, but the lack of space makes them hard to improve. Conversely, the ability to protect a base in late game is based upon the planetary shielding, which is extremely expensive, and is much less expensive when on an asteroid.%0a%0a5) Day 7: At each of your bases have at least the following:%0a100 Fighters%0a3 Cruisers%0a2 of the most advanced turrets available to level 2 (10/10).%0a%0a6) Your Key Production bases should have an additional 100 Fighters and an extra Cruiser.%0a%0a7) Day 10: Have a level of above 10.0%0a%0a8) Day 20: Have a minimum econ of 250%0a%0a9) Day 35: Have a minimum level of 20.0%0a%0a10) Specialization is key!%0a%0a11) NAP = Non Aggression Pact. This means you do not attack them%0a%0a12) KOS = Kill on Spot. This means any time you see this player you are encouraged to attack.%0a%0a13) Ceti is a very dangerous place. Without making alliances or NAP the larger guilds will just pick off the smaller guilds. These NAPs allow us some protection. However they may turn on us in the future, we do NOT under any circumstance do the first move. This just means that you should always be on your guard and try to be friends with our NAPs so we can further our progress and relationship with these other guilds.%0a%0a1) Do not attack them%0a2) If there is a problem first thing you do is message a diplomat, guild master or commander and chief.%0a3) Only under his permission do you take any action.%0a4) More experienced players are willing to help you out so just ask them for advice if you have any questions%0a%0a13) Even though you are protected under newbie protection for the first 7 days, you still need to protect your trade routes because they can be pillaged. To prevent this is easy. All you need to do is build one fighter on all your bases and this can be prevented until the 7th day when your protection disappears.%0a%0a14)acces (m) = minutes that have gone by since you have lefted a post on the message board or done anything active on AE%0a%0aErgo:%0a%0aConquest and occupation will only give you limited income, and the cost to occupy a base is often more expensive that what you receive from it. Especially true if the base owner has invested in command centers. Each Galaxy has a Galactic Commander, who is responsible for coordination in that galaxy. Without his or her help, protection and liberation of players would not be possible. In order to protect yourself and to better your benefit your play in AE we need the following information from you.%0a%0a1) The location of all your bases%0a%0a2) The fleet of your bases%0a%0a3) any other guilds in the area of your base that are a threat and are not NAPs%0a%0a4) Guild commanders always report there orders in announcements so always read the red tab announcements%0a%0a5) Sightings of unusually strong players outside of our guild that you have seen, both independent and in other guilds.%0a%0a6) Your thoughts on what challenges you are currently facing. We are here to help you so either post your problems in the message board under general or talk to your guild commander%0a%0a7) Post any new trade routes in the trades tab. Always post the location of your base with the free trade route, the current econ for the astro (planet) and the desired galaxy you want your trading partners in.%0a%0a8) Your thoughts on what players and guilds are possible threats to your success and be prepared to discuss options on how to mitigate these threats.%0a%0a9) Progress reports to your galaxy commander about fleet developments, technology and attack fleets.%0a%0a10) When you join message the commander that you are in the same galaxy with. Cxx The first two “x”s are the galaxy you are in. They will need your base location and what fleet you have at that location.%0a%0aWhat You Can Expect from Guild Leadership: (commander/ Professors/ People in Charge):%0a%0a1) Information. Lots of information.%0a%0a2) A willing ear to discuss options on how to help you reach your goals.%0a%0a3) A big brother in a bad neighborhood that will go to great lengths to insure that together we will all be successful.%0a%0a4) When you join message the commander that you are in the same galaxy with. Cxx The first two “x”s are the galaxy you are in. They will need your base location and what fleet you have at that location.%0a%0aNewbie Build Goals%0a==================%0a%0a1) Day 5: Turn your attention to preparing the defense of your bases.%0a%0a2) Day 7: At each of your bases have at least the following:%0a100 Fighters%0a3 Cruisers%0a2 of the most advanced turrets available to level 2. This mean 10/10 on the top 2 turret classes you have%0a%0a3) Your Key Production bases should have an additional 100 Fighters and an extra Cruiser.%0a%0a4) Day 10: Have a level of above 10.0%0a%0a5) Day 20: Have a minimum econ of 250%0a%0a6) Day 35: Have a minimum level of 20.0%0a%0aTrade Routes%0a============%0a%0aTrade is normally 30 to 50 percent of your income. That means trade is%0aimportant. As a general goal, by day 7 you should have 11--12 income%0afrom each route. The table below shows why 15 spaceports is an ideal%0agoal for each base. The trade formula has a multiplier which emphasizes%0atrading at a distance with as many other players as possible. With this%0aknowledge in hand, you should easily draw half your income from trade.%0a%0a(:table cellspacing=0:)%0a(:cellnr:)Spaceports%0a(:cell:)1%0a(:cell:)5%0a(:cell:)10%0a(:cell:)15%0a(:cellnr:)Trade Routes%0a(:cell:)1%0a(:cell:)2%0a(:cell:)3%0a(:cell:)4%0a(:tableend:)%0a%0a:Trade Route Formula:%0aIncome =((Sqrt(lowest Base Economy)*(1+Sqrt(Distance)/75 +Sqrt(Players)/10))%0a%0aThis formula reveals two important points based on the multiplier.%0aFirst, the number of unique players you trade with increases the value%0aof all you trade routes. For example, if you trade with 9 people, you%0atrade multiplier is increased by 0.3. If you trade with 16 people, the%0amultiplier is increased by 0.4. Second Distance is important. If you%0amanaged to find a trade route 5625, the multiple would be 1. A route%0adistance of 1000 is a multiplier of 0.42. Combined, that means that%0aa trade route of 1000 for a player with 16 unique trading partners has a%0atrade multiplier of 0.82. With 36 unique partners, that is a multiplier%0aof 1.02.%0a%0aWhen you first start out, trading with yourself is okay. You may have%0adifficulties finding trading partners. However, you use two trade routes%0ato net the same profit you would have if each route were shared with a%0adifferent partner. The distinction is that you have fewer unique%0apartners and your trade multiplier is reduced.%0a%0a%0aMoving Fighters Using Hanger Based Ships%0a========================================%0a%0a1) Choice the fleet your fighters and hanger ready ships are%0a%0a2) Hit move button under the location "planet name" (Cxx:xx:xx:xx)%0a%0a3) Hit the max button on the ships you want to have fighters to go in%0a%0a4) Hit hanger infront of the bomber/fighters you want docked%0a%0a5) Or you can type in the number of fighters you want in the hangers that are less then the max amount%0a%0a6) It should have a (-) in light black what fighters are in hangers and a white number where the fighters are in ships that are hanger ready%0a%0a7) Then you copy and paste your destination in the destination box, on the lower right you use your bookmarks, or lower left your base locations%0a%0aMore Advanced Topics%0a====================%0a%0aPlanet Layout%0a-------------%0a%0aA major consideration is specializing planets and optimizing production,%0aeconomy and research. The following table presents decent long-term%0agoals for each of your bases. Be mindful that this is a guideline and%0ayour unique situation may require a different layout. For example, if%0ayou managed to build on an Oceanic world, the value of Metal Refineries%0ais a waste of space.%0a%0a%0a(:table cellspacing=0 class=structure:)%0a(:cellnr:)&nbsp;%0a(:cell class=heading:)Minimum%0a(:cell class=heading:)Production%0a(:cell class=heading:)Research%0a(:cell class=heading:)Economy%0a(:cellnr class=heading:)Metal Refineries%0a(:cell align=right:)17%0a(:cell align=right:)19%0a(:cell align=right:)17%0a(:cell align=right:)17%0a(:cellnr class=heading:)Robotic Factories%0a(:cell align=right:)5%0a(:cell align=right:)5%0a(:cell align=right:)14%0a(:cell align=right:)10%0a(:cellnr class=heading:)Nanite Factories%0a(:cell align=right:)9%0a(:cell align=right:)10%0a(:cell align=right:)9%0a(:cell align=right:)10%0a(:cellnr class=heading:)Android Factories%0a(:cell align=right:)3%0a(:cell align=right:)5%0a(:cell align=right:)3%0a(:cell align=right:)3%0a(:cellnr class=heading:)Shipyards%0a(:cell align=right:)10%0a(:cell align=right:)20%0a(:cell align=right:)10%0a(:cell align=right:)10%0a(:cellnr class=heading:)Orbital Shipyards%0a(:cell align=right:)-%0a(:cell align=right:)1%0a(:cell align=right:)-%0a(:cell align=right:)-%0a(:cellnr class=heading:)Research Labs%0a(:cell align=right:)-%0a(:cell align=right:)-%0a(:cell align=right:)22%0a(:cell align=right:)-%0a(:cellnr class=heading:)Crystal Mines%0a(:cell align=right:)-%0a(:cell align=right:)-%0a(:cell align=right:)-%0a(:cell align=right:)19%0a(:cellnr class=heading:)Command Centers%0a(:cell align=right:)5%0a(:cell align=right:)5%0a(:cell align=right:)5%0a(:cell align=right:)5%0a(:cellnr class=heading:)Spaceports%0a(:cell align=right:)15%0a(:cell align=right:)15%0a(:cell align=right:)15%0a(:cell align=right:)15%0a(:tableend:)%0a%0aPlanet Choice%0a-------------%0a%0aThese are good pros and cons for each type of planet (astro). The%0ageneral consensus for planet choices are the following:%0a%0aEach astro has different trades that make them better for certain%0aspecializations. The general consensus on Astro Empires is to specialize%0athe following planets:%0a%0a* Research: Earthly, Arid, Tundra, Gaia%0a* Economy: Asteroid, Crystalline%0a* Production: Rocky, Crater, Metallic%0a%0aThe best worlds are: slot 2 crystal moons/planet, any crystal%0amoon/planet, and slot 2 asteroids. Why? Slot 2 (CXX:XX:XX:2X) worlds have%0aa boost to fertility. Slot 1 worlds have more solar energy, but the%0afertility boost reduces the number of Urban Structures you need. This is%0amore important as there are alternatives to Solar Plants. Generally, a%0amoon is prefered to a planet. While the planet has more area to build,%0ait costs twice as much to defend in the long term. Area can be increased%0avia Terraforming and other technologies. Defense costs by astro type%0a(i.e. moon or planet) is fixed.%0a%0a%0aNewbie Attack Fleet%0a===================%0a%0a* 4000 Fighters (FT)%0a* 100 Carriers (CA)%0a* 100 Cruisers (CR)%0a* 20 Heavy Cruiser (HC)%0a%0a>>note%3c%3c%0aNote: 10 bases should have the following defense use the formula @@econ * 12@@ to determine fighter defense. With 100 econ there should be a fighter screen of 1200 fighters (12 fighters per 1 point of economy). These goals take time so don't be frustrated keep at it.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0aNext:%0a%0aWhen you hit 1200 fighters build 5 cruisers to 1 heavy cruiser till you%0aget 100 cruisers/20 heavy cruisers on all your bases...then build the%0aremaining 800 fighters on all your bases so you have 2000 fighters a%0abase. Then build 10 battleships and 1 dreadnaught. Ideally you want at%0aleast 1250 econ so you can build 25 fighters an hour per base...10%0abases. Always keep the ratio when adding to this as 60 fighters to 1%0acarrier to 10 cruisers to 5 heavy cruisers to 1 battleship.  %0aEventually, your defense fleet (and a good base attack fleet) for all%0abases should be:%0a%0a'''Attack Fleet'''%0a%0a* 2000 fighters%0a* 50 carriers%0a* 200 recyclers%0a* 200 cruisers%0a* 20 heavy cruisers%0a* 10 battleships%0a* 1 dreadnought%0a%0a'''Base Defense Fleet'''%0a%0a* 2000 fighters%0a* 100 cruisers%0a* 40 heavy cruisers%0a* 5 battleships%0a* 1 dreadnought%0a%0aAlways add to this by using this ratio:%0a%0a* 400 fighters (1 fleet carrier)%0a* 20 cruisers%0a* 5 heavy cruisers%0a* 1 battleship%0a* 0.2 dreadnought%0a

The%0a%3c general consensus for planet choices are the following:%0a%3c %0a%3c Each astro has different trades that make them better for certain%0a%3c specializations. The general consensus on Astro Empires is to specialize%0a%3c the following planets:%0a%3c %0a%3c * Research: Earthly, Arid, Tundra, Gaia%0a%3c * Economy: Asteroid, Crystalline%0a%3c * Production: Rocky, Crater, Metallic%0a%3c %0a%3c The best worlds are: slot 2 crystal moons/planet, any crystal%0a%3c moon/planet, and slot 2 asteroids. Why? Slot 2 (CXX:XX:XX:2X) worlds have%0a%3c a boost to fertility. Slot 1 worlds have more solar energy, but the%0a%3c fertility boost reduces the number of Urban Structures you need. This is%0a%3c more important as there are alternatives to Solar Plants. Generally, a%0a%3c moon is prefered to a planet. While the planet has more area to build,%0a%3c it costs twice as much to defend in the long term. Area can be increased%0a%3c via Terraforming and other technologies. Defense costs by astro type%0a%3c (i.e. moon or planet) is fixed.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Newbie Attack Fleet%0a%3c ===================%0a%3c %0a%3c * 4000 Fighters (FT)%0a%3c * 100 Carriers (CA)%0a%3c * 100 Cruisers (CR)%0a%3c * 20 Heavy Cruiser (HC)%0a%3c %0a%3c >>note%3c%3c%0a%3c Note: 10 bases should have the following defense use the formula @@econ * 12@@ to determine fighter defense. With 100 econ there should be a fighter screen of 1200 fighters (12 fighters per 1 point of economy). These goals take time so don't be frustrated keep at it.%0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c %0a%3c Next:%0a%3c %0a%3c When you hit 1200 fighters build 5 cruisers to 1 heavy cruiser till you%0a%3c get 100 cruisers/20 heavy cruisers on all your bases...then build the%0a%3c remaining 800 fighters on all your bases so you have 2000 fighters a%0a%3c base. Then build 10 battleships and 1 dreadnaught. Ideally you want at%0a%3c least 1250 econ so you can build 25 fighters an hour per base...10%0a%3c bases. Always keep the ratio when adding to this as 60 fighters to 1%0a%3c carrier to 10 cruisers to 5 heavy cruisers to 1 battleship.  %0a%3c Eventually, your defense fleet (and a good base attack fleet) for all%0a%3c bases should be:%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Attack Fleet'''%0a%3c %0a%3c * 2000 fighters%0a%3c * 50 carriers%0a%3c * 200 recyclers%0a%3c * 200 cruisers%0a%3c * 20 heavy cruisers%0a%3c * 10 battleships%0a%3c * 1 dreadnought%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Base Defense Fleet'''%0a%3c %0a%3c * 2000 fighters%0a%3c * 100 cruisers%0a%3c * 40 heavy cruisers%0a%3c * 5 battleships%0a%3c * 1 dreadnought%0a%3c %0a%3c Always add to this by using this ratio:%0a%3c %0a%3c * 400 fighters (1 fleet carrier)%0a%3c * 20 cruisers%0a%3c * 5 heavy cruisers%0a%3c * 1 battleship%0a%3c * 0.2 dreadnought%0a
