In January 2005, we began tinkering with a Lexicon called the [[Macropedia/Macropedia]]. We weren't sure what to expect, but in the first five months we produced over one-hundred articles detailing the period known as the Imperium. The structure of the Lexicon has helped us keep going.%0a[[#body]]%0a(:title The Story So Far:)
