text=>>success%3c%3c%0aUpdated June 2009%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0aThis advanced base guide focuses on base specialization and location.%0aThe Astro Layout section sets minimum build goals for bases depending on%0atheir specialization.  The Planet Choice section shares common wisdom on%0awhich astros work better in which specialization. Both sections describe%0atime-tested methods. This page has an accompanying%0a[[AdvancedBaseGuideFAQ|Frequently Asked Questions]] pages. If you find%0aan area confusing and the FAQ is unhelpful, notify Merovech (Gamma).%0a%0a>>note%3c%3c%0aThis guide focuses on base specialization and is not relevant for all players. Players who play free accounts should consider specializing due to restrictions on space.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a(:*toc:)%0a%0aAstro Layout%0a============%0a%0aThe three major areas of activity on a base are fleet production,%0aresearch, and commerce. Because space is a premium on all astros, it is%0acritical that you build your empire by specializing your astros%0aaccordingly. All bases should have a minimum structure, but%0aspecialization helps a given base reach its potential. This section%0adiscusses basic empire organization and specific base structures. Specialization is necessary for Free accounts, not necessary for upgraded accounts. So, if you're upgraded, take that into account.%0a%0aBasic Empire Organization%0a-------------------------%0a%0aFor a basic empire, you will want three %0aCommerce(:footnote Most guides call these ``economy" astros. I prefer to call the ``commerce" because I have a symbol for commerce I use.:) %0aastros, two Research Astros, three%0aProduction astros, and a balance of Production/Research astros%0a(dual-purpose).  Your first will likely be a dual Production/Research%0abase, this arrangement provides ten bases---the goal of %0a[the Ten-Seven Guide](TheTenSevenGuide). When building your initial empire,%0ayour second, third and fourth bases should be commerce specialized to%0ahelp jump start your economy. The table below suggests an order in which%0ayou may build your bases.%0a%0a>>warn%3c%3c%0aCommerce bases are of dubious value. Consider building them up briefly%0ain the beginning, then converting them to Production bases.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a[[#order]]%0a(:bburl #baseorder:)%0a|| cellspacing=0 class=structure%0a||!

In [[the Ten Seven Guide]], %0ayou are advised to start with a Rocky, Crater or Metallic%0aplanet; to optimize production. These three astros are suited for%0aProduction, yet you have to build eight Research Labs to expand your%0abases. Rather than later disband those Labs (recovering only half of%0awhat you spent), the recommendation is that you make your first base%0adual-purpose. %0a%0aI personally find that whenever I start I end up with an Arid or Tundra,%0aboth of which are better for research. So, to meet my above%0arecommendation, you have to restart your account. I find this wasteful,%0awhen the first astro is typically suitable for Research or Research and%0aProduction. Later in this guide, I recommend which astros are I find are%0aworth having.%0a%0aBase Structure Goals%0a--------------------%0a%0aA major consideration is specializing astros and optimizing production,%0acommerce and research.  The following table presents decent long-term%0agoals for each of your bases. Be mindful that this is a guideline and%0ayour unique situation may require a different layout. For example, if%0ayou managed to build on an Oceanic world, the value of Metal Refineries%0ais a waste of space. However, to play this game effectively, you'll want%0ato take heed of the preferred astros discussed later. Oceanics are a%0awaste.%0a%0aFree players are severely limited in what they can build. Space is a%0apremium. Therefore, they should focus on securing planets, which is%0adiscussed in greater detail below---as which astros are preferred.%0aThe minimum layout in the table below shows the basic structure that%0ashould work for all free players. It's a good goal for upgraded players%0aas well, until you need to grow beyond its offerings. The [[production structures]] are balanced for cost.%0a%0aThe goals listed here are easily possible for a player under Level 30.%0aThese goals allow a player to build the key infrastructure for a base%0awithout heavy research requirements. Orbital Bases, Androids Factories,%0aAntimatter Plants and Multi-Level Platforms all require substantial%0aresearch to construct.

Adding the other four Shipyards (needed for Battleships) on an%0aAsteroid would require Urban-16, but no new Fusion Plants. This adds%0afive slots, which is just outside the limits of a %0aTerraformed Asteroid.(:footnote The ready solution is to drop two Robotic Factories from the goal, which gives the space required.:)%0a%0aThe '''Research column''' represents the minimum build with 22 Research Labs.%0aThis is enough for Cybernetics, but not enough for Tachyon.

Notice the%0areduced number of Robotic Factories; saving energy and space.%0a%0aThe '''Commerce column''' assumes a Slot-2 Crystal optimized. These are%0aextremely rare, which helps underscore why Crystals are '''more hype than value'''. In reality, a player is better served with a Slot-2 Rocky with%0aSpaceport-20 than with a Crystal base. The added economy and trade route is worth 30 credits,%0awhich is more than adding the Crystal Mines. The Real Economy row shows%0ain parenthesis the potential value of a Slot-2 Rocky with Spaceport-20%0a(based on the quality of your empire's Trade Routes.)%0a%0aAstro Choice%0a============%0a%0aBase location is a critical concern for a successful empire. Remember%0athe real estate mantra: ``Location, location, location." This section%0adiscusses the three considerations in astro selection.%0a%0aAstro Specialization and Type%0a-----------------------------%0a%0aThese are good pros and cons for each type of astro. The%0ageneral consensus for astro choices are the following:%0a%0aEach astro has different advantages that make them better for certain%0aspecializations. The general consensus on Astro Empires is to specialize%0athe astros below. If the astro is not below, do not waste your time. The%0aemboldened astro is the preferred choice for a given specialization.%0a%0a[[#choice]]%0a(:bburl #choice:)%0a|| class=structure cellspacing=0%0a||! Specialization ||!

When astro hunting, always make a note of%0aCrystalline, Gaia and Rocky astros. If you do not plant a base there,%0asomebody will. There are a lot of Asteroids, otherwise I would recommend%0acharting them, too.%0a%0aFree account players should add 25 to the astro's area to represent the%0amaximum possible space they will have available with terraforming. Once%0ayou research Armour-22, you should add another 50 to the astro's area to%0arepresent the limits you will encounter with Multilevel Platforms. Thus,%0aan Asteroid will never have more than 140 spaces for structures.%0a%0aAstro Orbit Preferences%0a-----------------------%0a%0a>>takeaway%3c%3c%0aPrefer Metal-3, Slot-2 astros. Planets if you need space, moons and roids if you want cheap prings. %0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a'''Choose Slot Twoes.''' Naturally, you will let your needs influence your decision on which astro to take. %0aWhen you can be choosy, prefer a Slot 2 orbit (e.g.  GXX:XX:XX:'''2'''X). %0aSlot 2 orbits have 3 solar energy, which provides cheap,%0aaccessible energy.(:footnote When your Energy research gets to level 20, you will be pulling 6 energy from Solar Plants. They are also cheaper than Fusion Plants, which should allow you to absorb the minor loss in space.:)%0aSlot 2 orbits also increase base Fertility by one, which reduces the%0ainfrastructure you need to build your base.(:footnote Slot 3 orbits also have a boost to fertility, but the loss in solar energy (2 instead of 3) makes Slot 3 a poor choice:)%0aThis easy access to cheap energy and improved fertility is what makes Slot 2 orbits preferable.%0a%0a'''Slot 1 orbits are the second preference''' because they have higher solar%0aenergy but less %0afertility.(:footnote The trade-off may not be aparent at first.  When you research Energy-3, your Solar Plants will produce one more energy.  This means energy deficits are easier to remedy than population deficits, which makes Slot 2 the better choice.:)%0a%0aSlot 3 and beyond are terrible choices as you are always in a deficit in%0aeither energy or fertility. The exception is Toxic in Slot 4 or Slot 5.%0aThis is because Gas is better and mitigates problems with lower%0afertility. You may chose a Slot-3 if you can afford the extra Fusion%0aplants you will have to build to offset the low solar output. You still%0aget the Slot-2 fertility benefit.%0a%0aChoosing a Moon or Planet%0a------------------------%0a%0a>>note%3c%3c%0aPlanets if free account player%0aMoons if upgraded%0aAstroids if you're patient.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a'''Should you choose a moon or a planet?''' If you are going to play with a%0afree account, you should focus on planets. Otherwise, you should focus%0aon moons. This is because of limitations of space. Free players are%0alimited to five terraform structures. This puts a ceiling on the number%0aof structures they can build. Therefore, free players need the larger%0aastros to maximize what they can build.%0a%0aConversely, upgraded players have no ceiling on structures. This allows%0apaying characters to focus on other issues; such as cost.  Deflection%0aShields, Planetary Shields and Planetary Rings cost 25 percent less on%0aMoons than Planets. That is a gross savings of 1024, 6250 and 12500%0acredits, respectively. The size difference between a Moon and Planet is%0ausually surmounted by two Terraforming, which costs 192 credits. Thus,%0ait is cheaper to occupy Moons in the long term for upgraded players.%0a%0aAt least, this is the traditional logic. I need to look into this%0afurther to determine if there is real cost savings.%0a%0aOf course, if you focus on planets, you will pay full price for Prings%0aand Pshields. Moons cost half as much, and asteroids a quarter as much.%0a%0a[[!Sidebar]] [[!Guides]]%0a%0a(:comment This page has been edited using Pywe:)%0a(:title Advanced Base Guide:)

That is a savings of 1024, 6250 and 12500 credits,%0a%3c respectively. The size difference between a Moon and Planet is usually%0a%3c surmounted by two Terraforming, which costs 192 credits. Thus, it is%0a%3c cheaper to occupy Moons in the long term for upgraded players.%0a---%0a> on moons. Why? Planetary Shields cost less on a moon, making them the%0a> preferred choice.

The%0a%3c general consensus for planet choices are the following:%0a%3c %0a%3c Each astro has different trades that make them better for certain%0a%3c specializations. The general consensus on Astro Empires is to specialize%0a%3c the following planets:%0a%3c %0a%3c * Research: Earthly, Arid, Tundra, Gaia%0a%3c * Economy: Asteroid, Crystalline%0a%3c * Production: Rocky, Crater, Metallic%0a%3c %0a%3c The best worlds are: slot 2 crystal moons/planet, any crystal%0a%3c moon/planet, and slot 2 asteroids. Why? Slot 2 (CXX:XX:XX:2X) worlds have%0a%3c a boost to fertility. Slot 1 worlds have more solar energy, but the%0a%3c fertility boost reduces the number of Urban Structures you need. This is%0a%3c more important as there are alternatives to Solar Plants. Generally, a%0a%3c moon is prefered to a planet. While the planet has more area to build,%0a%3c it costs twice as much to defend in the long term. Area can be increased%0a%3c via Terraforming and other technologies. Defense costs by astro type%0a%3c (i.e. moon or planet) is fixed.%0a%3c %0a
