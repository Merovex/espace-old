The parts that are based on the worm (this is a highly engineered variant) make up the large bulk.  The musculature and the nervous system of the modified worm serves both to greatly amplify the strength and reactions of the individual wearing the suit.  The bio-AI net is smart enough to co-ordinate all these activities, and while not a full intelligence, is quite capable of integrating into the human nervous system without any heavy modification to the human.²²Contributers/AaronClausen - March 06, 2005
