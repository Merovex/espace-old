text=Ok, so first of all, this is not my make, but I'd rather say it's a compilation from various sources AND from my experience. Who am I? Search for "Dacus" in the beta server and you'll find out Wink%0aAlso you can contact me for comments and improvements you might have to this.%0a%0aA quick warning and very important too: DON'T BUILD any defenses nor fleets (except one single fighter at all your bases which have at least one TR- this will prevent others to plunder your trade routes) during these 7 days, they are useless to you as in these 7 days you can't fight, you can't attack and you cannot be attacked, so bear in mind that you're losing money building those; money you can spend better in investing into your future empire. You should build however MAX 2 scouts to help you scout other regions you can't see and when you see good planets you want to take, bookmark them and then move on. In case you already used your bookmarks and there are no more bookmarks available (full list), just make notes and post there the coordinates.%0a%0a-=-=-=-%0a%0aNow let's get down to business. When you start a new account, it's preferred that you start on a moon, not a planet with at least 3 solar or gas and more than 4 fertility, unless you start on a crystalline type moon. I'll tell you why later.%0aSo, until you get an astro with at least 5 fertility and at least 2 metal (best to be 3), and at least 2 solar or 2 gas (best will be at least one to be 4), you'll need to restart again. So the BEST target astro to start with is a Rocky-like astro and should be solar or gas >= 4 AND fertility >=5 AND metal 3 and DO NOT choose an asteroid as it's small area will hinder your future efforts of upgrading it.%0a%0aNow that you have your base (Click on Bases, then Home Planet), click on structures and click build next to Metal Refineries. Then scroll down, there should be a queue structures button and a list of buildings you can queue. Queue up 1 Research lab and 4 metal refineries. Note that you may have to queue a power plant or an urban structure in between them. This is because each building takes up a certain amount of energy and 1 population. You can see those stats in the top of the page. Always build the power plant that gives more energy. Otherwise you're just wasting space. Add these only when you need them. Always remember to keep your queue list full, especially if you're going somewhere or going to sleep. The queue list will finish by itself unless you run out of credits or you messed the queue list up. And when you do run out of credits, the queue list activates when you do have the credits to build.%0a%0aWhen that Research Lab was built, go to research and research Computer. Then queue 1 more Computer. While you're doing that, build a spaceport, then a shipyard. When your 2 computer research finishes, build a robotics factory.%0a%0aThis is the basics of what you should do on all your planets, except for the research labs and stuff.%0a%0aMeaning, that after all this, you should have this:%0a%0aStructures%0a1 Research Lab%0a4 Metal Refineries%0a1 Robotics Factory%0a1 Shipyard%0a1 Spaceport%0a%0aIn Queue:%0aMetal Refinery%0aSpaceport%0aRobotics Factory%0aShipyard%0aResearch Lab%0a%0aAnd repeat. Add power plants and urban structures whenever necessary too. The specific order is because when you only focus on upgrading one structure, the cost steadily gets higher and your economy and construction won't be able to handle it. Alternating structures makes your economy and base stats grow faster and easier.%0a%0aResearch%0a%0a2 Computer%0a%0aYou'll need that and 5 Research labs. Don't build them all at once, but slip them in the queue line every once in a while. Get them by the end of the day.%0a%0aNow, this is what I expect if you started early:%0a%0a5 Research Labs%0a7 Metal Refineries%0a4 Robotics%0a4 Shipyards%0a4 Spaceports%0a%0a2 Computer%0a%0aGo for 1 Energy and 5 more Energy in the queue.%0a%0aIf you started late, try to get that in queue and rest up for tomorrow.%0a%0a-----%0a%0aSecond day, time to get to work. It's more building and research and if you were active, you might run out of credits today. This is what you should get by the end of the day, following the rule of alternating structure building:%0a%0a8 Research Labs%0a10 Metal Refineries%0a6 Robotics Factories%0a6 Shipyards%0a6 Spaceports%0a%0aQueue 2 shipyards and as many metal refineries as you can before you go to sleep. I'd say 12 metal refineries on the planet is good.%0a%0a8 Energy%0a2 Computer%0a4 Stellar Drive%0a%0aIf you didn't get 4 stellar drive, you're either bankrupt or not active. After you get 4 stellar drive, queue a Warp Drive. If you have 4 stellar but can't find Warp Drive, this is because you don't have 8 research labs.%0a%0aIf you're bankrupt, don't worry, the queue list will do your work for you while you're asleep.%0a%0a-----%0a%0aBefore starting, read the whole tutorial again to remember the steps you need to take.%0a%0aDay 3, now is the time to start building Outpost Ships. These require 8 Shipyards, 1 Warp Drive, and 100 credits on hand. Yes, the sole purpose of the above is to get Outpost Ships as early as possible. If you were able to get these on the second night, you're way ahead, and you have a pretty good chance of getting 10 planets before your account expires.%0a%0aAs a general rule it's a good idea to have 4 economy based astros, 3 Research based astros and 2 mixes Production&Research astros (the first one you'll get will have to be Economy&Production&Research). As the game will progress you'll adjust your planets accordingly, but these are some kind of required for the long run.%0a%0aI'd advise you to get the economy astros first to boost your economy (to help you expand), then the Prod&Research astros and in the end the Research astros.%0a%0aOutpost ships let you build new bases on other uninhabited planets. These are the suggested ones to build on:%0a%0aCrystallines - Rare, but worth getting. I prefer crystallines with 3 solar and 5 fertility, but those are really rare. Frankly, I don't really care about the stats of them, but if they don't have those stats, you might have some problems with developing it. On this kind of planets a different kind of build is necessary. Ok, start always with metal refineries and robotic factory. and at the same time build crystal mines. you know metal refineries and robotic factory accelerate the building. when the crystal mines start getting expensive, alternate it with economic center (based on cost). and don't forget building good defense on it. Get AT MOST 4 of this kind, then go for something else.%0a%0aRocky - Pretty common, and are pretty good production bases. I prefer 3 solar and 6 fertility, but 4 solar and 5 fertility work fine too. I also prefer it being a moon instead of a planet (the reason why is at the end of this).%0a%0aMetallic or Craters - Also common, and are also pretty good production bases. Don't pay much attention to the 1 crystal, as it's really not worth it. 3 solar and 5 fertility is what I'd go for. I'd also prefer a moon over a planet for this one as well.%0a%0aAsteroids - Not as rare as Crystallines, but they're good to work with. Its only drawback is its small area. I'd also prefer 3 solar and 5 fertility on this, because 4 fertility really hurts when you need to upgrade level 17 urban structures. These aren't as rare, so I do suggest finding these stats. try to alternate crystal mines with spaceports at the beginning. during this 7 days protection you need economy. after you could always change of discretion for production%0a%0aIf you started on a Rocky or Metallic, I'd also suggest an Arid (or Tundra), Gaia (if you can get one) or Earthly or planet for your 10th planet to use it as your research base.%0a%0aWhen you're setting up your new base, you'll notice there's a fee. For your first base, it'll cost you 50 credits. Every base after the last will cost twice what it used to. Like so:%0a%0a50%0a100%0a200%0a400%0a800%0a%0aAnd so on. Your tenth planet will cost you 12800 credits. That sounds like a lot, but don't worry. You'll be able to do it if you're pretty active.%0a%0aOnce you've set up your base, follow the instructions from day 1 and 2, except without the research labs. These stats are what you should attain on all your planets, regardless of type:%0a%0a12 Metal Refineries%0a8 Robotics%0a8 Shipyards%0a10 Spaceports%0a%0aAs for research, aim for this and this only:%0a%0a10 Energy%0a10 Computer%0a8 Laser%0a4 Stellar Drive%0a1 Warp Drive%0a%0aThis will unlock Economic Centers and Nanite Factories. Build up to level 3 of both on all your bases. Remember to alternate.%0a%0aI expect you to get a total of 3 bases by the end of the day and 2 more outpost ships in construction for tomorrow.%0a%0a-----%0a%0aBefore starting, read the whole tutorial again to remember the steps you need to take.%0a%0aDay 4, you should be starting to really rack in the credits with an economy of over 100. Use those outpost ships to get 2 more planets. You should have around 200 economy by the end of the day, maybe a little less. Build 2 more outpost ships for tomorrow.%0a%0a-----%0a%0aBefore starting, read the whole tutorial again to remember the steps you need to take.%0a%0aDay 5, you should have the credits to build your 6th base, and construct your 7th base by nightfall, which costs 1600 and 3200 credits. Remember to get all the above stats for all your planets. By the end of the day you should have about 400 economy or more. Build 3 more outpost ships.%0a%0a-----%0a%0aBefore starting, read the whole tutorial again to remember the steps you need to take.%0a%0aDay 6, this is the crucial day, and you should be able to build your 8th and 9th base in the afternoon and tomorrow morning. You must have around 650 economy and stop all construction and research a couple hours before your upgraded account ends.%0a%0a-----%0a%0aBefore starting, read the whole tutorial again to remember the steps you need to take.%0a%0aDay 7, spend all day waiting for 12800 credits and if you're worried, recycle some structures. Then build your 10th base. Feel free to do whatever you want from then on.%0a%0a%0aADVICES%0a-=-=-=-%0a%0aKeep in mind the following:%0a%0aVery important: DON'T BUILD any defenses nor fleets during these 7 days, they are useless to you as in these 7 days you can't fight and you can't attack, so bear in mind that you're losing money building those; money you can spend better in investing into your future empire. You'll have enough time to build fleets after these few start days.%0a%0aHOWEVER, when the day 6 of your account is at the end, start building defenses and fleets on all your bases and stop constructing, so that you'll have money for your defenses:%0a1) fighters and Cruisers as fleet in the ratio 60 FTs to 1 CR. For example a good fleet for defense is 6000 FTs and 100 CRs%0a2) any turrets you can buy with shields (aim for the highest turret possible - early on disruptors if possible, later aim for the planetary rings). And don't build many shields - 1 batch maximum of each kind of shield. The idea is to hurt the invader Smile%0a%0aFertility is the amount of population you add when building Urban Structures.%0aAs each building takes one people, you'll need a lot of people, and Urban Structures are getting very expensive.%0aEx, Urban Structure level 20 cost you 3326 credits. But with a level 20 urban on a fertility 6 planet gives you a total of 20*6 = 120 people, whereas on a fertility 4 it gives you only 80 people.%0a%0aA point for planet occupation, for each occupied planet you need one Command Center, so build some.%0a%0aTo occupy a planet, don't forget newbies have a 7 days protection%0asend corvettes or scouts to the nearby quadrants to seek acceptable targets (very low or no defense, no or small fleet).%0aYou can only attack people who have account start > 7 and (their player level - your player level) %3c 10%0aWhen you find a target, send a sufficient fleet to conquer the base. In the beginning you should find people conquerable with a single corvette but soon you'll need more (some corvettes and destroyers).%0aConquer the base.%0aConquered bases give you credit by first pillage, then pillage once per day, and you take 30%25 of their economy.%0aKeep a small fleet above the planet, the occupied people will try to make fleets to free their planets. We call that 'popping debris' Wink%0a%0athere are other rules about level of protection when you get into the higher degrees, but that's going to happen a lot later, so I'll not describe here%0a%0aat first, have focused bases.%0aone for top science,%0aone for top ship building,%0asome just for econ (i.e. crystallines or asteroids)%0aand as you get high in each base's focus, start building up other aspects of that base.%0aput jump gate on your best shipyard bases...%0ayour standard hybrid is a shipyard/research mix, but all bases should be making as much econ as they can, and should keep construction speeds up...%0aand don't forget defenses...%0a%0aWhy moons and not planets?%0a1) On a moon the costs for building planetary rings and planetary shields is a LOT less - believe me it's worth the extra cash you're saving%0a2) On a moon the cost of Bio Mod is a lot less - the same as above%0a3) Moons are not so searched for, as people hurry for the planets, so you're going to have a variety of moons to choose from Smile%0a%0aYou should choose planets and not moons ONLY when you have NO intention of upgrading. Planets offer you more space so they are more suitable for free accounts. However, in case you can't upgrade I advise you to contact other people who are upgraded and offer them something in return (in-game or in real-life), so that they upgrade your account too. Believe me, this game is worth to be played while upgraded Smile So beg from your parents, your spouse or from your siblings to get you upgraded Smile

We call that 'popping debris' Wink%0a%3c %0a%3c there are other rules about level of protection when you get into the higher degrees, but that's going to happen a lot later, so I'll not describe here%0a%3c %0a%3c at first, have focused bases.%0a%3c one for top science,%0a%3c one for top ship building,%0a%3c some just for econ (i.e. crystallines or asteroids)%0a%3c and as you get high in each base's focus, start building up other aspects of that base.%0a%3c put jump gate on your best shipyard bases...%0a%3c your standard hybrid is a shipyard/research mix, but all bases should be making as much econ as they can, and should keep construction speeds up...%0a%3c and don't forget defenses...%0a%3c %0a%3c Why moons and not planets?%0a%3c 1) On a moon the costs for building planetary rings and planetary shields is a LOT less - believe me it's worth the extra cash you're saving%0a%3c 2) On a moon the cost of Bio Mod is a lot less - the same as above%0a%3c 3) Moons are not so searched for, as people hurry for the planets, so you're going to have a variety of moons to choose from Smile%0a%3c %0a%3c You should choose planets and not moons ONLY when you have NO intention of upgrading. Planets offer you more space so they are more suitable for free accounts. However, in case you can't upgrade I advise you to contact other people who are upgraded and offer them something in return (in-game or in real-life), so that they upgrade your account too. Believe me, this game is worth to be played while upgraded Smile So beg from your parents, your spouse or from your siblings to get you upgraded Smile %0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
