text=I'm not sure how we would fair. To wage war we first have to ensure we can strike and that our players can either defend themselves or stand alone. %0a%0aThose too weak to fight in the war should be encouraged to break off into another guild so they aren't dragged into it with us---sort of like Kittens of Steel allows some Kittens guild members to fight in this war without dragging Kittens into it.%0a%0aScouting%0a========%0a%0aWe need full and accurate scouting of SYN bases so we will know which galaxies will bear the brunt. I anticipate C51 is one such area, but as I am primarily in C51---I would think that. Full and accurate scouting means: base locations, fleet strengths, tech levels. This level of scouting would require discretion over a week to make happen. %0a%0aBuild-Up%0a========%0a%0aWe should time the attack for a weekend day (or night) so we can have full activity. All fleet should be quietly staged to within 2 hours of their targets (more below). All unnecessary Construction should stop (and Research) and all effort should go into building fleet as what we throw at SYN will suffer attrition. That is, we should be building the replacement fleets as the first fleets hit the line. %0a%0aNo player should hold more than a few hours reserve income. Any ``banking" of income should be in long term (i.e. 50+ hour) research which is cashed in for Production. This low-cash-on-hand limits the negative impact of a SYN occupation.%0a%0aTargeting%0a===========%0a%0aWe should target specific players and locate their bases. The goal is 100 percent occupation of SYN players. It will almost completely take out that player. Which players are targets should be based on tactical reasons: defense ratios, location, etc. If possible, medium to strong players should be taken out. The weaker players won't be as able or willing to cover the stronger players. Cut the head and the body will whither.%0a%0aOccupations should linger but not be significant. That is, we punch a player out then retreat to a neutral astro (leaving a token force to hold occupation). We know that SYN will rally to the defense of an occupation; especially when the occupation is 100 percent. By withdrawing a fleet, we can track their activities and either plan to strike other SYN bases or destroy the covering fleet.%0a%0aCoordinated Fleet Actions%0a=========================%0a%0aNaturally, fleet actions must be efficient. I think breaking into 5 member teams with a single team leader is a natural fit. It is how the military operate on a tactical level: two teams (A & B) work in a squad, four squads to a platoon, etc. Ideally, there would be an A and B team. The A Team would engage on the initial assault. The B team would hold for follow-up, harassing and defending/covering actions.%0a%0aTrade routes between SYN players must be severed. Optimal economy has 30--50 percent of income as trade. Occupying a player and killing all his trade routes will set him back weeks. We should anticipate the same. By destroying only SYN routes, we reduce the likelihood of bringing other guilds into the fray. We also ensure that our initial strike exacts maximum damage on the total SYN guild economy.%0a%0aTo silently sneak fleet, we move a large fleet (e.g. 2000/100/60 FT/CR/HC) in small units (200/10/5). This minimizes the time on scanner. Being within two hours limits detection when the final move occurs. At H-Hour minus 3 (three hours before attack), players should move to the nearest neutral astro. By not moving to the target astro, we reduce the likelihood of detection because not all are vigilant about watching their Scanners.%0a%0aIn the last few minutes before H-Hour (attack), all fleets move from their final staging astro to their target. Assuming all are in place in the same quarter hour, we should light their board up with dozens of attack reports. Hit hard, strike deep and pull out quick.%0a%0aWe should anticipate a full on counter-attack and the likelihood of a long-term defeat. This attack approach smacks more of Pearl Harbor than of Port Arthur; based on our ability to wage long-term operations and prior planning.
