text=PLANET GENERATION SYSTEM%0a------------------------%0a%0aVersion 2.0 (4-Dec-95)%0aCopyright 1995 by Ross Smith %3calien@netlink.co.nz>%0a%0a(:toc:)%0a%0a!! INTRODUCTION%0a%0aThis is a reasonably quick and simple system for generating complete planetary systems in rough detail, and the most interesting planets in somewhat greater detail. It also includes a system for generating intelligent life forms. It isn't tied to any particular game mechanics, and should be usable with any SFRP system.%0a%0aI designed it because I've never been very impressed by the planet generation schemes in most SF role-playing games, which are usually either too unrealistic or too complicated (or, frequently, both). I wanted a scheme that was simple enough to generate systems fairly quickly, while still being designed by someone who knew one end of a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram from the other (hint: neither end is likely to have anything resembling Earth orbiting it).%0a%0aYou will need some six-sided and ten-sided or twenty-sided dice (or, of course, a computer with a good random number function). I assume you're familiar with the usual dice notation (so you know what something like "2D6+3" means). This system requires rolls on D6, D10, D20, and D100.  Unless otherwise stated, all results of less than zero should be counted as zero, and all fractional results should be rounded to the nearest whole number (round halves upwards).%0a%0a>>note%3c%3c%0aThis file is copyright 1995 by Ross Smith.

STAR SYSTEMS%0a%0a%0aIn the local region of the Galaxy, there is about one star system per 600 cubic light-years. I suggest using cube-shaped sectors either 25 or 50 light-years on a side. A 25 light-year sector has 8D6-2 star systems (average 26); a 50 light-year sector has 6D20+145 systems (average 208; more appropriate to generation by a computer program than by hand). Place the systems at random within the sector (roll D100/4 or D100/2 for each of the X, Y, and Z coordinates).%0a%0aTo find the number of stars in a system, roll D100 on the following table:%0a%0a    D100   Stars%0a    -----  -----%0a    1-40   1%0a    41-90  2%0a    91-99  3%0a    100    4%0a%0aStars are classified into seven "spectral types", based on their temperature and colour. The types are O (blue), B (blue-white), A (white), F (yellow-white), G (yellow), K (orange), and M (red); astronomers use the mnemonic "Oh, Be A Fine Girl, Kiss Me" to remember the sequence. The seven types are each divided into ten subclasses, indicated by a digit from 0 to 9 after the spectral type (except type O, which is normally divided only into subclasses 5 to 9). The Sun, for example, is type G2.%0a%0aA Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is a plot of stars with spectral type on the horizontal axis and luminosity on the vertical axis. The majority of stars fall into the "main sequence", which runs roughly diagonally, from bright, blue-white O-type stars at the top left of the diagram to dim M-type red dwarfs at the bottom right, with yellow dwarfs like the Sun falling almost exactly in the middle. Other types of stars are above or below the main sequence.%0a%0aRed giants (indicated by a "g" prefix on the spectral type, e.g. "gM5") and supergiants (indicated by a "c" prefix, e.g. "cK0") are late stages in the life cycle of massive stars. White dwarfs (indicated by a "D" prefix, e.g.  "DA"), much dimmer than most main sequence stars, are the final stage in the evolution of most stars. The most massive stars will end up as neutron stars or black holes (these have no spectral types; the tables below use "NS" and "BH" to represent them).%0a%0aFor each star in a system, roll D100 (one to three times) on the following table, to get the general description and the specific spectral class of the star. A subclass number should also be generated for main sequence and giant stars (white dwarfs are not usually given a subclass).  The stars in a system should be listed in descending order of luminosity.  Take the basic groups in order (supergiants, giants, main sequence, white dwarfs, neutron stars, black holes); within each group, list stars in order of spectral type.%0a%0a    First  Second  Third   Basic          Spectral  Subclass%0a    D100   D100    D100    type           class%0a    -----  ------  ------  -------------  --------  ---------%0a    1      1       1-10    Supergiant     cB        D10-1%0a    ...    ...     11-20   ...            cA        D10-1%0a    ...    ...     21-40   ...            cF        D10-1%0a    ...    ...     41-60   ...            cG        D10-1%0a    ...    ...     61-80   ...            cK        D10-1%0a    ...    ...     81-100  ...            cM        D10-1%0a    ...    2-5     --      Giant          gF        D10-1%0a    ...    6-10    --      ...            gG        D10-1%0a    ...    11-55   --      ...            gK        D10-1%0a    ...    56-95   --      ...            gM        D10-1%0a    ...    96-99   --      Neutron star   NS        --%0a    ...    100     1-20    Black hole     BH        --%0a    ...    ...     21-100  Main sequence  O         (D10/2)+4%0a    2      --      --      ...

This level of detail is probably unnecessary for gaming. If you're using a star catalogue that uses this system, you can convert the full luminosity classes to the broad classes I've used here using the following table.%0a%0a    Luminosity class               Description%0a    -----------------------------  -------------%0a    I                              Supergiant%0a    O-A II, F II-III, G-M II-IV    Giant%0a    O-A III-VI, F IV-VI, G-M V-VI  Main sequence%0a    VII                            White dwarf%0a%0a%0a!! PLANETARY SYSTEMS%0a%0aRefer to the following table to generate the number of planets for each star. First determine whether there are any planets; for multiple star systems, roll only once for the whole system, using the spectral type of the primary star. If the result is affirmative, generate the number of planets for each star, based on the star's own spectral type.%0a%0a    Star                     Spectral  Probability  Number of%0a    type                     class     of planets   planets%0a    -----------------------  --------  -----------  ---------%0a    Giant/supergiant         All       10%25          D6%0a    Main sequence            O-B       10%25          D10%0a    ...

Zone A is the inner or hot zone; zone B is the intermediate or life zone; and zone C is the outer or cold zone (in our system, Mercury and Venus are in zone A, Earth and Mars are in zone B, and the asteroids and outer planets are in zone C). The following table indicates which planets are in each zone for main sequence, giant, and supergiant stars; all planets of white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes are considered to be in zone C.%0a%0a    Total    Planets in   Planets in   Planets in%0a    planets  zone A       zone B       zone C%0a    -------  -----------  -----------  ----------%0a    1-3      --           Planet 1     Planets 2+%0a    4-5      Planet 1     Planet 2     Planets 3+%0a    6-7      Planet 1     Planets 2-3  Planets 4+%0a    8+       Planets 1-2  Planets 3-4  Planets 5+%0a%0aAt this point, if the star is a member of a multiple system, remove the outermost D6+1 planets (this may leave the star with no planets). Determine the planetary zones before deleting planets.%0a%0aFor each planet, three parameters are determined: type, size, and number of moons. Roll D100 and refer to the following table for planet type, then generate the size and moons.%0a%0a    Planet         D100                    Diameter      Number%0a    type           Zone A  Zone B  Zone C  (km)          of moons%0a    -------------  ------  ------  ------  ------------  --------%0a    Asteroids      1-5     1-5     1-5     --            --%0a    Giant          --      6-8     6-75    3D6x10000     2D10%0a    Rock           6-60    9-40    76-80   D10x1000      D6xD6/10%0a    Cold           --      --      81-90   D10x1000      D6xD6/10%0a    Desert         61-70   41-60   91-95   (2D6+2)x1000  `D6xD6/10%0a    Hostile [*1]   71-100  61-80   96-100  (3D6+1)x1000  `D6xD6/10%0a    Marginal [*2]  --      81-90   --      (2D6+5)x1000  `D6xD6/10%0a    Earthlike [*2] --      91-100  --      (2D6+5)x1000  `D6xD6/10%0a%0a    [*1: Count as "cold" if the star is a white dwarf, neutron star, or%0a    black hole.]%0a%0a    [*2: Count as "hostile" if the star is anything other than a main%0a    sequence star of type F, G, or K.]%0a%0aAsteroids: A collection of rocks that never combined to form a planet.  Usually there will be a handful of large asteroids a few hundred kilometres across, and a vast number of smaller objects.%0a%0aGiant: A huge planet consisting mainly of hydrogen, ranging from ten to a thousand times the Earth's mass. Example: Jupiter.%0a%0aRock: A small, rocky planet with no atmosphere. Example: Mercury.%0a%0aCold: A small planet with no atmosphere, composed mainly of ice; found only in the outer part of a system. Example: Pluto.%0a%0aDesert: Comparable in size to Earth, but with a barren surface and a thin, inert atmosphere. Example: Mars.%0a%0aHostile: Comparable in size to Earth, with an atmosphere containing no (or a negligible amount of) oxygen, but possibly with some other active component. Hostile planets may occasionally have native life forms, but they will be based on a very non-Earthlike biochemistry. Example: Venus.%0a%0aMarginal: Almost Earthlike, with oxygen in the atmosphere, but with some serious problem that makes it an unpleasant place to live, such as very high or low temperature, atmospheric pressure, or oxygen level; traces of some toxic gas in the atmosphere; dangerous volcanic activity; or high radiation level. No examples in our solar system.%0a%0aEarthlike: Oxygen atmosphere, temperatures not too far outside the human comfort zone, and a reasonably stable surface. Note that the presence of oxygen in the atmosphere necessarily implies the presence of life (oxygen is too reactive to occur in large amounts from geological processes alone, and would disappear in a relatively short time if life were to become extinct). Example: Earth.%0a%0aThe details of a system's planets can be conveniently written using the initial letter of the planet type, the size in thousands of kilometres, and a dot followed by the number of moons, if any. Asteroid belts are simply indicated by an "A" with no numbers (and are not counted towards the "official" number of planets). Use slashes to mark the zone boundaries.

EARTHLIKE AND MARGINAL PLANETS%0a%0a!!! PHYSICAL DETAILS%0a%0aGenerate a planet's orbit period using the table below, dependent on the spectral type of its sun. If there are two Earthlike or marginal planets orbiting the same star, generate two periods and assign them in the correct order (the inner planet, obviously, gets the shorter period). If the outer period is less than 25%25 more than the inner one, generate both of them again.%0a%0a    Star type  Orbit period%0a               (Earth days)%0a    ---------  -------------%0a    F0-F4      (2D100x3)+600%0a    F5-F9      (2D100x2)+400%0a    G0-G4      2D100+270%0a    G5-G9      2D100+150%0a    K0-K4      D100+120%0a    K5-K9      D100+70%0a%0aTo find the planet's rotation period, roll D100, add 10 for each moon, add 10 if the planet orbits a K-type star, and refer to the following table.%0a%0a    Result   Rotation%0a    -------  ------------%0a    1-65     D20+9 hours%0a    66-90    D20+20 hours%0a    91-98    D10 days%0a    99-103   D100 days%0a    104-150  D10 days%0a%0aRoll D6/2+3 (keep fractions, don't round) for the planet's density in grams per cubic centimetre. Multiply diameter by density and divide by 70000 to calculate the surface gravity in Earth gravities (round to the nearest 0.1).%0a%0aRoll 2D6-4 for Earthlike planets, or D10+D6-6 for marginal planets, and multiply by 5 to find the average surface temperature in degrees Celsius (negative numbers should be retained here, not counted as zero). If a star has two planets in zone B and both of them are Earthlike or marginal, make sure the temperatures are in the right order; the outer planet should have a temperature no higher than the inner one (greenhouse effects and similar phenomena can affect a planet's temperature, but not by all that much on a planet with an approximately Earthlike atmosphere). If the outer planet's temperature comes out higher, either swap them around (if the planets are both Earthlike or both marginal) or generate both temperatures again (if there is one of each).%0a%0aUse the following table to determine the proportion of the planet's surface covered by dry land, water, and ice. Roll dice for the water and ice areas (count less than zero as zero, more than 100%25 as 100%25); the land area is whatever remains. If the water and ice areas add up to more than 100%25, roll both again.%0a%0a    Average       Water        Ice%0a    temperature   area         area%0a    ------------  -----------  ------------%0a    -20 to -10 C  (D10-5)x5 %25  (D10+10)x5 %25%0a    -5 to 5 C     (D20-5)x5 %25  D10x5 %25%0a    10 to 20 C    (5D6-8)x5 %25  (D6-2)x5 %25%0a    25 to 35 C    (5D6-8)x5 %25  (D6-3)x5 %25%0a    40 to 50 C    (5D6-8)x5 %25  (D6-4)x5 %25%0a%0aIf the land and water percentages are both greater than zero, the oceans are assumed to be salt water (unless the planet has the "freshwater oceans" special feature; see below). If the land percentage is zero, any oceans will be fresh water (salt reaches the ocean through runoff from the land; if there's no land, there's no salt).  A planet's mineral resources are measured on an arbitrary scale, running from 1 (worst) to 100 (best). The Earth is rated 80, fairly high, because of its high density (implying a relatively high ratio of metal to rock), and its active volcanic and tectonic processes (which carry minerals from deep in the interior to the surface). A planet's mineral resources rating is generated by the formula:%0a%0a    Minerals = (Diameter / 500) + (Density x 10) + (D100 / 2) - 45%0a%0a%0a!!!

Always inedible, and usually extremely poisonous.%0a%0aNon-carbon-based: Completely different to Earth's biochemistry in every way. Invariably poisonous. Very rare, at least on anything resembling an Earthlike planet.%0a%0a%0a!!! SPECIAL FEATURES%0a%0aThere is no such thing as a typical Earthlike planet; every world is unique. To reflect this, some Earthlike or marginal planets will have one or more "special features" that are not covered by the usual planetary parameters. Roll a D100 three times on the following table to determine what the features are. If you get the same result (other than "No special feature") twice, roll again.%0a%0aMost features are restricted to planets with certain properties (for example, the "Freshwater oceans" feature obviously requires an ocean percentage greater than zero), or are incompatible with certain other features (for example, a planet can't have both "High inclination" and "No seasons"). Some features are sufficiently hazardous to human health that they are restricted to marginal planets. See the detailed descriptions below for explanations of the incompatibilities and prerequisites.

Incompatible with "No seasons".%0a%0aHigh inclination: The planet's axis is tilted by more than 45 degrees, producing extreme temperature differences between summer and winter.  Incompatible with "No seasons".%0a%0aHigh tides: A large, close moon or sun produces extremely high tides.  Requires either a K-type sun or at least one moon, and both land and water areas to be non-zero.%0a%0aMeteor storms: The planet suffers frequent meteor storms, often including large asteroid or comet impacts, making the planet's surface a dangerous place. Marginal planets only.%0a%0aNo seasons: The planet has close to zero axial inclination and orbital eccentricity, so there are no seasonal effects. Requires a single star; incompatible with "Eccentric orbit" or "High inclination".%0a%0aRings: The planet has a natural ring system.%0a%0a%0aGEOLOGICAL FEATURES%0a%0aRadiation hazard: Radioactive minerals, or fallout from a nuclear war, create a significant radiation hazard over large parts of the planet.  Marginal planets only.%0a%0aRugged terrain: The planet's land surface is almost entirely covered with mountains and rough, rocky terrain, with practically no flat plains or rounded hills. Requires a non-zero land area; incompatible with "Swampy surface".%0a%0aVolcanic activity: The planet has many active volcanos, enough to make life dangerous over a large part of its surface. Marginal planets only.%0a%0a%0aHYDROGRAPHIC FEATURES%0a%0aFreshwater oceans: The planet's oceans have very little salt in them, either because they're geologically young or because some life form has affected their composition. Requires both the land and water areas to be non-zero. If the land area is zero and the water area is non-zero, this feature is automatically present, independently of the special feature rolls.%0a%0aMany islands: The planet's land surface is broken up into a large number of small islands, with no large continents. Requires both the land and water areas to be non-zero.%0a%0aPoisonous oceans: The oceans contain some contaminant or (more likely) life form that makes the planet's sea water (and probably some of its fresh water) poisonous to humans. Marginal planets only; requires a non-zero ocean area.%0a%0aSwampy surface: Most of the planet's land surface is low-lying and covered with swamps, marshes, mud, quicksand, and so on. Requires a non-zero land area; incompatible with "Rugged terrain".%0a%0a%0aATMOSPHERIC FEATURES%0a%0aCloud cover: The planet has a permanent cloud cover over its entire surface; it probably rains most of the time. Requires a temperature greater than zero; incompatible with "Very thin atmosphere".%0a%0aToxic gas: The atmosphere contains some gas which is poisonous to humans, making filter masks necessary. Marginal planets only.%0a%0aUnstable climate: The climate undergoes severe and unpredictable changes from year to year.%0a%0aVery dense atmosphere: The atmosphere is dense enough to be unbreathable without special respirator equipment, except perhaps on very high mountains. Marginal planets only; incompatible with "Very thin atmosphere".%0a%0aVery thin atmosphere: The atmosphere is too thin to breathe without special respirator equipment, except perhaps in very deep valleys. Marginal planets only; incompatible with "Cloud cover" or "Very dense atmosphere".%0a%0a%0aBIOLOGICAL FEATURES%0a%0aIntelligent life: The planet has a native sentient life form, which may or may not have advanced technology. Requires at least level III life; incompatible with "Semi-intelligent life". Less likely with life below level V (25%25 chance, otherwise roll again).%0a%0aSemi-intelligent life: The planet has a native life form which is not fully sentient yet, but comes close, and may develop further. Requires at least level III life; incompatible with "Intelligent life". Less likely with life below level V (25%25 chance, otherwise roll again).%0a%0aWorld forest: The entire land surface (except ice caps, probably) is covered by a single huge forest. Requires a non-zero land area, and at least level II life.%0a%0a%0aARCHAEOLOGICAL FEATURES%0a%0aAncient artifacts: Artifacts left behind by aliens, thousands or millions of years ago, exist on the planet.

COLONISATION%0a%0a!!! SECTOR CHARACTERISTICS%0a%0aTwo characteristics need to be determined for an entire sector. First, decide how "civilised" the sector is -- that is, how much contact it has had with interstellar society in general, and how much development has been done. Second, choose the "opening date" for the sector -- the date at which colonisation of the sector began.%0a%0aIdeally, these should be decided before you start, rather than generated at random. The following table is a suggestion for those who want one.%0a%0a    D100    Sector description  Initial colonisation%0a    ------  ------------------  ----------------------%0a    1-30    Unexplored          D6x50 years ago%0a    31-60   Frontier            2D6x50 years ago%0a    61-90   Typical             (2D6x50)+250 years ago%0a    91-100  Developed           (2D6x50)+500 years ago%0a%0a!!! PLANET QUALITY%0a%0aHabitable (Earthlike or marginal) planets can be rated according to their desirability for human colonisation. Of course, aliens may have different criteria; if your universe includes many alien colonies, you may have to modify these rules.%0a%0aPlanet quality (PQ) ranges from 1 to 99 for habitable planets (a planet rated 0 would be uninhabitable, and 100 is excluded on the reasonable assumption that nothing is perfect).

Some minor modifications may be required to fit some details of the aliens' home world, if you've already generated it; most of these should be obvious enough that I don't need to spell them out (for example, if the planet has no life more advanced than invertebrates, you can exclude the vertebrates from the "metabolism and body structure" roll).%0a%0aFind the normal environment of the species:%0a%0a    D100   Environment%0a    -----  --------------%0a    1-80   Land-dwelling%0a    81-82  Burrowing%0a    83-94  Amphibious%0a    95-99  Aquatic%0a    100    Flying%0a%0aFind the type of metabolism and body structure:%0a%0a    D100    Metabolism and body structure%0a    ------  -----------------------------%0a    1-15    Cold-blooded invertebrate%0a    16-20   Warm-blooded invertebrate%0a    21-30   Cold-blooded vertebrate%0a    31-100  Warm-blooded vertebrate%0a%0aFind the type of body covering:%0a%0a    D100    Types of body covering%0a    ------  ----------------------%0a    1-75    One main type%0a    76-100  Two main types%0a%0a    D100                                              Body covering%0a    Flying  Invertebrate  Cold-blooded  Warm-blooded%0a                          vertebrate    vertebrate%0a    ------  ------------  ------------  ------------  -------------%0a    1-10    1-25          1-10          1-20          Soft-skinned%0a    15-20   26-50         11-30         21-30         Thick-skinned%0a    21-40   51-60         31-35         31-90         Furred%0a    31-80   61            36            91            Feathered%0a    81-89   62-70         37-80         92-97         Scaled%0a    90      71-75         81-83         98            Spiny%0a    91-100  76-100        84-100        99-100        Hard-shelled%0a%0aUse the first column for all flying creatures; otherwise, use the column appropriate to the creature's body type.

D10+2%0a%0a(If you're wondering why most of the creatures with radial symmetry have five limbs, it's not just Earth prejudice; there are good engineering reasons why five is the optimum number of limbs for a creature with radial symmetry. Having an even number of body segments is a bad idea, because it weakens the body by placing several continuous seams around it. A creature with three arms would probably be unable to survive if it lost one; five are much better for redundancy. There are some echinoderms on Earth with more than five limbs, but not many.)%0a%0aFor creatures with radial symmetry, all limbs are assumed to be dual purpose arm/legs. Flying creatures with radial symmetry are assumed to be lighter-than-air, balloon-like creatures.%0a%0aFor creatures with bilateral symmetry, roll once for each pair of limbs, except as noted below:%0a%0a    D100    Type of limbs%0a    ------  --------------------------------------------------------------%0a    1-10    Wings if flying; fins if amphibious or aquatic; otherwise legs%0a    11-50   Fins if aquatic (not amphibious); otherwise legs%0a    51-70   Legs%0a    71-75   Dual-purpose arm/legs%0a    76-100  Arms%0a%0aFor flying creatures, assign one pair of limbs as wings without rolling (wings generated on the table are additional pairs). All intelligent creatures will have at least one pair of hands (either arms or arm/legs).  If you get a result that violates any of these checks, start again. If the creature has more than ten limbs, roll only for the first five pairs; the rest are all assumed to be legs.%0a%0aFind the creature's diet:%0a%0a    D100    Diet%0a    ------  -----------%0a    1-10    Herbivorous%0a    20-70   Omnivorous%0a    80-100  Carnivorous%0a%0aFind the creature's method of reproduction:%0a%0a    D100   Type of reproduction%0a    -----  --------------------%0a    1-5    Asexual%0a    6-25   Hermaphroditic%0a    25-99  Two sexes%0a    100    Three sexes%0a%0a    D100                                      Method of reproduction%0a    Invertebrate  Cold-blooded  Warm-blooded%0a                  vertebrate    vertebrate%0a    ------------  ------------  ------------  ----------------------%0a    1-5           --            --            External budding%0a    6-80          1-70          1-30          Egg-laying%0a    81-100        71-100        31-100        Live-bearing%0a%0aFind the average mass and size of the creature; roll 2D10 for land-dwelling or amphibious creatures, 2D10+3 for aquatic creatures, or 2D6 for flying or burrowing creatures:%0a%0a    Result  Mass    Size%0a    ------  ------  ---------------%0a    2       2 kg    (2D6+5) x 4 cm%0a    3       5 kg    (2D6+5) x 6 cm%0a    4       10 kg   (2D6+5) x 8 cm%0a    5       15 kg   (2D6+5) x 9 cm%0a    6       20 kg   (2D6+5) x 10 cm%0a    7       30 kg   (2D6+5) x 11 cm%0a    8       40 kg   (2D6+5) x 12 cm%0a    9       50 kg   (2D6+5) x 13 cm%0a    10      60 kg   (2D6+5) x 14 cm%0a    11      75 kg   (2D6+5) x 15 cm%0a    12      100 kg  (2D6+5) x 16 cm%0a    13      150 kg  (2D6+5) x 18 cm%0a    14      200 kg  (2D6+5) x 21 cm%0a    15      300 kg  (2D6+5) x 24 cm%0a    16      500 kg  (2D6+5) x 28 cm%0a    17      1 t     (2D6+5) x 35 cm%0a    18      2 t     (2D6+5) x 45 cm%0a    19      5 t     (2D6+5) x 60 cm%0a    20      10 t    (2D6+5) x 75 cm%0a    21      20 t    (2D6+5) x 1 m%0a    22      50 t    (2D6+5) x 1.3 m%0a    23      100 t   (2D6+5) x 1.6 m%0a%0aFor flying creatures and snake-like creatures (any non-aquatic creatures without legs), multiply the size by 4.

SPECIAL FEATURES%0a%0aThis section covers the sort of features that many role-playing games treat as advantages and disadvantages -- natural weapons, unusually fast or slow speed, non-human senses, and so forth. Some features relevant to your game mechanics will have already been generated, such as the ability to fly or swim, extra hands, or whatever degree of natural armour is implied by the creature's body covering.%0a%0aAttributes such as strength, dexterity, intelligence and so on are too game-specific to be covered here. You'll have to wing it.%0a%0aRoll D6-3 to determine how many special features the species has. Then roll D100 on the following table the appropriate number of times; re-roll any repeated results. Some of the entries are double (e.g. "acute vision/poor vision"); the two are mutually exclusive, and there is a fifty-fifty chance of one or the other. The "acute" or "poor" senses are relative to human senses (which is why there's no "poor smell" feature -- the human sense of smell is pretty poor to start with).%0a%0aI haven't included precise definitions of the effects of each of these special features; any details beyond what is implied by the names would have to be worked out to fit your particular game mechanics.%0a%0a    D100                            Special abilities%0a    Herbivore  Omnivore  Carnivore%0a    ---------  --------  ---------  ------------------------------------%0a    1-18       1-17      1-16       Acute hearing/poor hearing%0a    19-30      18-28     17-26      Acute smell%0a    31-48      29-45     27-42      Acute vision/poor vision%0a    49-60      46-56     43-52      Ambidextrous%0a    61-62      57-58     53-54      Chameleon skin%0a    63-68      59-64     55-59      Cold sensitivity/cold tolerance [*1]%0a    69-74      65-70     60-64      Colour blind%0a    75-80      71-76     65-69      Heat sensitivity/heat tolerance [*1]%0a    81-86      77-82     70-74      Infrared vision%0a    87-91      83-88     75-84      Night vision%0a    92         89-91     85-89      Poison%0a    93         92        90         Radiation tolerance%0a    94         93        91         Radio communication%0a    95         94        92         Radio sense%0a    96         95        93         Ranged weapon%0a    97         96        94         Regeneration%0a    98         97-98     95-97      Sonar [*2]%0a    99         99        98         Suckers (wall climbing)%0a    100        100       99         Vacuum tolerance%0a    --         --        100        Web spinning%0a%0a    [*1: If you're creating an intelligent species for an already-generated%0a    planet, the planet's surface temperature will affect the natives'%0a    heat/cold tolerance.

PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE%0a%0aThe psychological profile of an intelligent species is described by a set of six numbers: social, cooperation, aggression, exploration, technology, and art. Each runs from 0 to 100.%0a%0aSocial: Indicates the degree of gregariousness and social organisation in their civilisation. A social rating of zero would indicate a totally solitary species with no social interaction at all; a social rating of 100 would indicate a hive-mind species with no concept of individual identity.  Some social contact is assumed to be required for the evolution of language and intelligence, so a social rating less than 5 is not allowed in this system.%0a%0aCooperation: Indicates how willing they are to cooperate with other intelligent species. A cooperation rating of zero would indicate a totally xenophobic species that refuses to even recognise the existence of any other intelligent life; a cooperation rating of 100 would indicate a race with no sense of species identity at all, making no distinction between their own conspecifics and aliens.%0a%0aAggression: Indicates how warlike they are, both among themselves and against other species. An aggression rating of zero would indicate a completely pacifist species that never fought anyone for any reason; an aggression rating of 100 would indicate a completely warlike species with no interest in any other activity. For obvious reasons there will be a negative correlation between the cooperation and aggression ratings (but not completely -- for example, a species that enjoyed fighting and frequently hired themselves out as mercenaries to anyone who needed soldiers might have a high rating in both areas, while a peaceful but isolationist species, such as Larry Niven's Puppeteers, would have a low rating in both).%0a%0aExploration: Indicates their curiosity and interest in research and exploring the universe. An exploration rating of zero would indicate a species with no curiosity at all (since this seems incompatible with intelligence, a rating of less than 5 is not allowed); an exploration rating of 100 would indicate a species completely obsessed with exploration or science.%0a%0aTechnology: Indicates their technological aptitude. A technology rating of zero would indicate a species with no technology of any kind; a technology rating of 100 would indicate a species obsessed with technology to the exclusion of anything else. There is a strong positive correlation between the exploration and technology ratings.%0a%0aArt: Indicates what part artistic activities play in their society. An art rating of zero would indicate a completely practical and utilitarian species, with no aesthetic sense at all (to humans they would seem cold and robotic); an art rating of 100 would indicate that aesthetic considerations completely dominated practical ones (this would not be a survival trait, which is why an art rating above 95 is not allowed). There is a negative correlation between the technology and art ratings.%0a%0a    Profile      Basic                            Modifiers      Allowed%0a    element      die roll                                        range%0a    -----------  -------------------------------  -------------  -------%0a    Social       (2D6x10)+D10-25                  Herbivore +10  5-100%0a                                                  Omnivore  0%0a                                                  Carnivore -10%0a    Cooperation  (2D6x10)+D10-25                  Herbivore 0    0-100%0a                                                  Omnivore  +5%0a                                                  Carnivore -5%0a    Aggression   (2D6x10)+D10-(Cooperation/5)-15  Herbivore -10  0-100%0a                                                  Omnivore  0%0a                                                  Carnivore +10%0a    Exploration  (2D6x10)+D10-25                  Herbivore -10  5-100%0a                                                  Omnivore  +5%0a                                                  Carnivore +5%0a    Technology   (D6x10)+D10+(Exploration/2)-15   --             0-100%0a    Art          (2D6x10)+D10-(Technology/5)-15   --             0-95%0a%0aIf the result is outside the allowed range, roll again.%0a%0a!!!

INTRODUCTION%0a%3c %0a%3c This is a reasonably quick and simple system for generating complete planetary systems in rough detail, and the most interesting planets in somewhat greater detail. It also includes a system for generating intelligent life forms. It isn't tied to any particular game mechanics, and should be usable with any SFRP system.%0a%3c %0a%3c I designed it because I've never been very impressed by the planet generation schemes in most SF role-playing games, which are usually either too unrealistic or too complicated (or, frequently, both). I wanted a scheme that was simple enough to generate systems fairly quickly, while still being designed by someone who knew one end of a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram from the other (hint: neither end is likely to have anything resembling Earth orbiting it).%0a%3c %0a%3c You will need some six-sided and ten-sided or twenty-sided dice (or, of course, a computer with a good random number function). I assume you're familiar with the usual dice notation (so you know what something like "2D6+3" means). This system requires rolls on D6, D10, D20, and D100.  Unless otherwise stated, all results of less than zero should be counted as zero, and all fractional results should be rounded to the nearest whole number (round halves upwards).%0a%3c %0a%3c This file is copyright 1995 by Ross Smith.

STAR SYSTEMS%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c In the local region of the Galaxy, there is about one star system per 600 cubic light-years. I suggest using cube-shaped sectors either 25 or 50 light-years on a side. A 25 light-year sector has 8D6-2 star systems (average 26); a 50 light-year sector has 6D20+145 systems (average 208; more appropriate to generation by a computer program than by hand). Place the systems at random within the sector (roll D100/4 or D100/2 for each of the X, Y, and Z coordinates).%0a%3c %0a%3c To find the number of stars in a system, roll D100 on the following table:%0a%3c %0a%3c     D100   Stars%0a%3c     -----  -----%0a%3c     1-40   1%0a%3c     41-90  2%0a%3c     91-99  3%0a%3c     100    4%0a%3c %0a%3c Stars are classified into seven "spectral types", based on their temperature and colour. The types are O (blue), B (blue-white), A (white), F (yellow-white), G (yellow), K (orange), and M (red); astronomers use the mnemonic "Oh, Be A Fine Girl, Kiss Me" to remember the sequence. The seven types are each divided into ten subclasses, indicated by a digit from 0 to 9 after the spectral type (except type O, which is normally divided only into subclasses 5 to 9). The Sun, for example, is type G2.%0a%3c %0a%3c A Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is a plot of stars with spectral type on the horizontal axis and luminosity on the vertical axis. The majority of stars fall into the "main sequence", which runs roughly diagonally, from bright, blue-white O-type stars at the top left of the diagram to dim M-type red dwarfs at the bottom right, with yellow dwarfs like the Sun falling almost exactly in the middle. Other types of stars are above or below the main sequence.%0a%3c %0a%3c Red giants (indicated by a "g" prefix on the spectral type, e.g. "gM5") and supergiants (indicated by a "c" prefix, e.g. "cK0") are late stages in the life cycle of massive stars. White dwarfs (indicated by a "D" prefix, e.g.  "DA"), much dimmer than most main sequence stars, are the final stage in the evolution of most stars. The most massive stars will end up as neutron stars or black holes (these have no spectral types; the tables below use "NS" and "BH" to represent them).%0a%3c %0a%3c For each star in a system, roll D100 (one to three times) on the following table, to get the general description and the specific spectral class of the star. A subclass number should also be generated for main sequence and giant stars (white dwarfs are not usually given a subclass).  The stars in a system should be listed in descending order of luminosity.  Take the basic groups in order (supergiants, giants, main sequence, white dwarfs, neutron stars, black holes); within each group, list stars in order of spectral type.%0a%3c %0a%3c     First  Second  Third   Basic          Spectral  Subclass%0a%3c     D100   D100    D100    type           class%0a%3c     -----  ------  ------  -------------  --------  ---------%0a%3c     1      1       1-10    Supergiant     cB        D10-1%0a%3c     ...    ...     11-20   ...            cA        D10-1%0a%3c     ...    ...     21-40   ...            cF        D10-1%0a%3c     ...    ...     41-60   ...            cG        D10-1%0a%3c     ...    ...     61-80   ...            cK        D10-1%0a%3c     ...    ...     81-100  ...            cM        D10-1%0a%3c     ...    2-5     --      Giant          gF        D10-1%0a%3c     ...    6-10    --      ...            gG        D10-1%0a%3c     ...    11-55   --      ...            gK        D10-1%0a%3c     ...    56-95   --      ...            gM        D10-1%0a%3c     ...    96-99   --      Neutron star   NS        --%0a%3c     ...    100     1-20    Black hole     BH        --%0a%3c     ...    ...     21-100  Main sequence  O         (D10/2)+4%0a%3c     2      --      --      ...

This level of detail is probably unnecessary for gaming. If you're using a star catalogue that uses this system, you can convert the full luminosity classes to the broad classes I've used here using the following table.%0a%3c %0a%3c     Luminosity class               Description%0a%3c     -----------------------------  -------------%0a%3c     I                              Supergiant%0a%3c     O-A II, F II-III, G-M II-IV    Giant%0a%3c     O-A III-VI, F IV-VI, G-M V-VI  Main sequence%0a%3c     VII                            White dwarf%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !! 3. PLANETARY SYSTEMS%0a%3c %0a%3c Refer to the following table to generate the number of planets for each star. First determine whether there are any planets; for multiple star systems, roll only once for the whole system, using the spectral type of the primary star. If the result is affirmative, generate the number of planets for each star, based on the star's own spectral type.%0a%3c %0a%3c     Star                     Spectral  Probability  Number of%0a%3c     type                     class     of planets   planets%0a%3c     -----------------------  --------  -----------  ---------%0a%3c     Giant/supergiant         All       10%25          D6%0a%3c     Main sequence            O-B       10%25          D10%0a%3c     ...

Zone A is the inner or hot zone; zone B is the intermediate or life zone; and zone C is the outer or cold zone (in our system, Mercury and Venus are in zone A, Earth and Mars are in zone B, and the asteroids and outer planets are in zone C). The following table indicates which planets are in each zone for main sequence, giant, and supergiant stars; all planets of white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes are considered to be in zone C.%0a%3c %0a%3c     Total    Planets in   Planets in   Planets in%0a%3c     planets  zone A       zone B       zone C%0a%3c     -------  -----------  -----------  ----------%0a%3c     1-3      --           Planet 1     Planets 2+%0a%3c     4-5      Planet 1     Planet 2     Planets 3+%0a%3c     6-7      Planet 1     Planets 2-3  Planets 4+%0a%3c     8+       Planets 1-2  Planets 3-4  Planets 5+%0a%3c %0a%3c At this point, if the star is a member of a multiple system, remove the outermost D6+1 planets (this may leave the star with no planets).

Usually there will be a handful of large asteroids a few hundred kilometres across, and a vast number of smaller objects.%0a%3c %0a%3c Giant: A huge planet consisting mainly of hydrogen, ranging from ten to a thousand times the Earth's mass. Example: Jupiter.%0a%3c %0a%3c Rock: A small, rocky planet with no atmosphere. Example: Mercury.%0a%3c %0a%3c Cold: A small planet with no atmosphere, composed mainly of ice; found only in the outer part of a system. Example: Pluto.%0a%3c %0a%3c Desert: Comparable in size to Earth, but with a barren surface and a thin, inert atmosphere. Example: Mars.%0a%3c %0a%3c Hostile: Comparable in size to Earth, with an atmosphere containing no (or a negligible amount of) oxygen, but possibly with some other active component. Hostile planets may occasionally have native life forms, but they will be based on a very non-Earthlike biochemistry. Example: Venus.%0a%3c %0a%3c Marginal: Almost Earthlike, with oxygen in the atmosphere, but with some serious problem that makes it an unpleasant place to live, such as very high or low temperature, atmospheric pressure, or oxygen level; traces of some toxic gas in the atmosphere; dangerous volcanic activity; or high radiation level. No examples in our solar system.%0a%3c %0a%3c Earthlike: Oxygen atmosphere, temperatures not too far outside the human comfort zone, and a reasonably stable surface. Note that the presence of oxygen in the atmosphere necessarily implies the presence of life (oxygen is too reactive to occur in large amounts from geological processes alone, and would disappear in a relatively short time if life were to become extinct). Example: Earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c The details of a system's planets can be conveniently written using the initial letter of the planet type, the size in thousands of kilometres, and a dot followed by the number of moons, if any. Asteroid belts are simply indicated by an "A" with no numbers (and are not counted towards the "official" number of planets). Use slashes to mark the zone boundaries.

If there are two Earthlike or marginal planets orbiting the same star, generate two periods and assign them in the correct order (the inner planet, obviously, gets the shorter period). If the outer period is less than 25%25 more than the inner one, generate both of them again.%0a%3c %0a%3c     Star type  Orbit period%0a%3c                (Earth days)%0a%3c     ---------  -------------%0a%3c     F0-F4      (2D100x3)+600%0a%3c     F5-F9      (2D100x2)+400%0a%3c     G0-G4      2D100+270%0a%3c     G5-G9      2D100+150%0a%3c     K0-K4      D100+120%0a%3c     K5-K9      D100+70%0a%3c %0a%3c To find the planet's rotation period, roll D100, add 10 for each moon, add 10 if the planet orbits a K-type star, and refer to the following table.%0a%3c %0a%3c     Result   Rotation%0a%3c     -------  ------------%0a%3c     1-65     D20+9 hours%0a%3c     66-90    D20+20 hours%0a%3c     91-98    D10 days%0a%3c     99-103   D100 days%0a%3c     104-150  D10 days%0a%3c %0a%3c Roll D6/2+3 (keep fractions, don't round) for the planet's density in grams per cubic centimetre.

If a star has two planets in zone B and both of them are Earthlike or marginal, make sure the temperatures are in the right order; the outer planet should have a temperature no higher than the inner one (greenhouse effects and similar phenomena can affect a planet's temperature, but not by all that much on a planet with an approximately Earthlike atmosphere). If the outer planet's temperature comes out higher, either swap them around (if the planets are both Earthlike or both marginal) or generate both temperatures again (if there is one of each).%0a%3c %0a%3c Use the following table to determine the proportion of the planet's surface covered by dry land, water, and ice. Roll dice for the water and ice areas (count less than zero as zero, more than 100%25 as 100%25); the land area is whatever remains.

If the land percentage is zero, any oceans will be fresh water (salt reaches the ocean through runoff from the land; if there's no land, there's no salt).  A planet's mineral resources are measured on an arbitrary scale, running from 1 (worst) to 100 (best). The Earth is rated 80, fairly high, because of its high density (implying a relatively high ratio of metal to rock), and its active volcanic and tectonic processes (which carry minerals from deep in the interior to the surface). A planet's mineral resources rating is generated by the formula:%0a%3c %0a%3c     Minerals = (Diameter / 500) + (Density x 10) + (D100 / 2) - 45%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!! 4.2.

Always inedible, and usually extremely poisonous.%0a%3c %0a%3c Non-carbon-based: Completely different to Earth's biochemistry in every way. Invariably poisonous. Very rare, at least on anything resembling an Earthlike planet.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!! 4.3. SPECIAL FEATURES%0a%3c %0a%3c There is no such thing as a typical Earthlike planet; every world is unique. To reflect this, some Earthlike or marginal planets will have one or more "special features" that are not covered by the usual planetary parameters. Roll a D100 three times on the following table to determine what the features are. If you get the same result (other than "No special feature") twice, roll again.%0a%3c %0a%3c Most features are restricted to planets with certain properties (for example, the "Freshwater oceans" feature obviously requires an ocean percentage greater than zero), or are incompatible with certain other features (for example, a planet can't have both "High inclination" and "No seasons"). Some features are sufficiently hazardous to human health that they are restricted to marginal planets. See the detailed descriptions below for explanations of the incompatibilities and prerequisites.

Incompatible with "No seasons".%0a%3c %0a%3c High inclination: The planet's axis is tilted by more than 45 degrees, producing extreme temperature differences between summer and winter.  Incompatible with "No seasons".%0a%3c %0a%3c High tides: A large, close moon or sun produces extremely high tides.  Requires either a K-type sun or at least one moon, and both land and water areas to be non-zero.%0a%3c %0a%3c Meteor storms: The planet suffers frequent meteor storms, often including large asteroid or comet impacts, making the planet's surface a dangerous place. Marginal planets only.%0a%3c %0a%3c No seasons: The planet has close to zero axial inclination and orbital eccentricity, so there are no seasonal effects.

Requires a non-zero land area; incompatible with "Swampy surface".%0a%3c %0a%3c Volcanic activity: The planet has many active volcanos, enough to make life dangerous over a large part of its surface. Marginal planets only.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c HYDROGRAPHIC FEATURES%0a%3c %0a%3c Freshwater oceans: The planet's oceans have very little salt in them, either because they're geologically young or because some life form has affected their composition. Requires both the land and water areas to be non-zero. If the land area is zero and the water area is non-zero, this feature is automatically present, independently of the special feature rolls.%0a%3c %0a%3c Many islands: The planet's land surface is broken up into a large number of small islands, with no large continents. Requires both the land and water areas to be non-zero.%0a%3c %0a%3c Poisonous oceans: The oceans contain some contaminant or (more likely) life form that makes the planet's sea water (and probably some of its fresh water) poisonous to humans. Marginal planets only; requires a non-zero ocean area.%0a%3c %0a%3c Swampy surface: Most of the planet's land surface is low-lying and covered with swamps, marshes, mud, quicksand, and so on. Requires a non-zero land area; incompatible with "Rugged terrain".%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ATMOSPHERIC FEATURES%0a%3c %0a%3c Cloud cover: The planet has a permanent cloud cover over its entire surface; it probably rains most of the time. Requires a temperature greater than zero; incompatible with "Very thin atmosphere".%0a%3c %0a%3c Toxic gas: The atmosphere contains some gas which is poisonous to humans, making filter masks necessary. Marginal planets only.%0a%3c %0a%3c Unstable climate: The climate undergoes severe and unpredictable changes from year to year.%0a%3c %0a%3c Very dense atmosphere: The atmosphere is dense enough to be unbreathable without special respirator equipment, except perhaps on very high mountains. Marginal planets only; incompatible with "Very thin atmosphere".%0a%3c %0a%3c Very thin atmosphere: The atmosphere is too thin to breathe without special respirator equipment, except perhaps in very deep valleys. Marginal planets only; incompatible with "Cloud cover" or "Very dense atmosphere".%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BIOLOGICAL FEATURES%0a%3c %0a%3c Intelligent life: The planet has a native sentient life form, which may or may not have advanced technology. Requires at least level III life; incompatible with "Semi-intelligent life". Less likely with life below level V (25%25 chance, otherwise roll again).%0a%3c %0a%3c Semi-intelligent life: The planet has a native life form which is not fully sentient yet, but comes close, and may develop further. Requires at least level III life; incompatible with "Intelligent life". Less likely with life below level V (25%25 chance, otherwise roll again).%0a%3c %0a%3c World forest: The entire land surface (except ice caps, probably) is covered by a single huge forest.

COLONISATION%0a%3c %0a%3c !!! 5.1. SECTOR CHARACTERISTICS%0a%3c %0a%3c Two characteristics need to be determined for an entire sector. First, decide how "civilised" the sector is -- that is, how much contact it has had with interstellar society in general, and how much development has been done. Second, choose the "opening date" for the sector -- the date at which colonisation of the sector began.%0a%3c %0a%3c Ideally, these should be decided before you start, rather than generated at random. The following table is a suggestion for those who want one.%0a%3c %0a%3c     D100    Sector description  Initial colonisation%0a%3c     ------  ------------------  ----------------------%0a%3c     1-30    Unexplored          D6x50 years ago%0a%3c     31-60   Frontier            2D6x50 years ago%0a%3c     61-90   Typical             (2D6x50)+250 years ago%0a%3c     91-100  Developed           (2D6x50)+500 years ago%0a%3c %0a%3c !!! 5.2. PLANET QUALITY%0a%3c %0a%3c Habitable (Earthlike or marginal) planets can be rated according to their desirability for human colonisation. Of course, aliens may have different criteria; if your universe includes many alien colonies, you may have to modify these rules.%0a%3c %0a%3c Planet quality (PQ) ranges from 1 to 99 for habitable planets (a planet rated 0 would be uninhabitable, and 100 is excluded on the reasonable assumption that nothing is perfect). Start with a base value of 50, and modify as described below. If the final result is less than 1, record it as 1; if it's more than 99, record it as 99.%0a%3c %0a%3c     Planet details                          PQ modifier%0a%3c     --------------------------------------  ----------------------%0a%3c     Planet type%0a%3c         Earthlike                           +35%0a%3c         Marginal                            0%0a%3c     Rotation period%0a%3c         Up to 2 days                        0%0a%3c         Greater than 2 days, up to 7 days   -5%0a%3c         Greater than 7 days                 -10%0a%3c     Surface gravity%0a%3c         Up to 1 G                           0%0a%3c         Over 1 G                            -5 per 0.1 G over 1%0a%3c     Surface temperature%0a%3c         Below 10 degrees                    -1 per degree below 10%0a%3c         10 to 30 degrees                    0%0a%3c         Over 30 degrees                     -1 per degree over 30%0a%3c     Land area%0a%3c         Zero                                -20%0a%3c         5%25 to 10%25                           -5%0a%3c         15%25 to 85%25                          0%0a%3c         90%25 to 95%25                          -5%0a%3c         100%25                                -10%0a%3c     Mineral resources                       +MR/4%0a%3c     Life development%0a%3c         No life                             -20%0a%3c         I: Single-celled organisms          -15%0a%3c         II: Simple invertebrates/plants     -10%0a%3c         III: Advanced invertebrates/plants  -5%0a%3c         IV: Simple vertebrates              0%0a%3c         V: Advanced vertebrates             0%0a%3c     Biochemistry%0a%3c         Earthlike                           0%0a%3c         Protein-based                       -10%0a%3c         Carbon-based                        -30%0a%3c         Non-carbon-based                    -50%0a%3c     Special features%0a%3c         Astronomical features%0a%3c             Eccentric orbit                 -10%0a%3c             High inclination                -5%0a%3c             High tides                      -5%0a%3c             Meteor storms                   -20%0a%3c             No seasons                      0%0a%3c             Rings                           0%0a%3c         Geological features%0a%3c             Radiation hazard                -30%0a%3c             Rugged terrain                  -5%0a%3c             Volcanic activity               -20%0a%3c         Hydrographic features%0a%3c             Freshwater oceans               0%0a%3c             Many islands                    0%0a%3c             Poisonous oceans                -30%0a%3c             Swampy surface                  -10%0a%3c         Atmospheric features%0a%3c             Cloud cover                     -10%0a%3c             Toxic gas                       -30%0a%3c             Unstable climate                -5%0a%3c             Very dense atmosphere           -30%0a%3c             Very thin atmosphere            -30%0a%3c         Biological features%0a%3c             Intelligent life [*1]           0%0a%3c             Semi-intelligent life [*1]      0%0a%3c             World forest                    0%0a%3c         Archaeological features%0a%3c             Ancient artifacts               +10%0a%3c %0a%3c     [*1: Depending on what sort of interstellar society your universe has,%0a%3c     you may decide that the presence of intelligent or semi-intelligent%0a%3c     life would place a world off limits to colonisation.]%0a%3c %0a%3c (For the statistically minded, to save you some calculations: Earthlike planets average 74, with standard deviation 15; marginal planets average 24, s.d. 18.)%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!! 5.3.

Having an even number of body segments is a bad idea, because it weakens the body by placing several continuous seams around it. A creature with three arms would probably be unable to survive if it lost one; five are much better for redundancy. There are some echinoderms on Earth with more than five limbs, but not many.)%0a%3c %0a%3c For creatures with radial symmetry, all limbs are assumed to be dual purpose arm/legs.

SPECIAL FEATURES%0a%3c %0a%3c This section covers the sort of features that many role-playing games treat as advantages and disadvantages -- natural weapons, unusually fast or slow speed, non-human senses, and so forth.

You'll have to wing it.%0a%3c %0a%3c Roll D6-3 to determine how many special features the species has. Then roll D100 on the following table the appropriate number of times; re-roll any repeated results. Some of the entries are double (e.g. "acute vision/poor vision"); the two are mutually exclusive, and there is a fifty-fifty chance of one or the other. The "acute" or "poor" senses are relative to human senses (which is why there's no "poor smell" feature -- the human sense of smell is pretty poor to start with).%0a%3c %0a%3c I haven't included precise definitions of the effects of each of these special features; any details beyond what is implied by the names would have to be worked out to fit your particular game mechanics.%0a%3c %0a%3c     D100                            Special abilities%0a%3c     Herbivore  Omnivore  Carnivore%0a%3c     ---------  --------  ---------  ------------------------------------%0a%3c     1-18       1-17      1-16       Acute hearing/poor hearing%0a%3c     19-30      18-28     17-26      Acute smell%0a%3c     31-48      29-45     27-42      Acute vision/poor vision%0a%3c     49-60      46-56     43-52      Ambidextrous%0a%3c     61-62      57-58     53-54      Chameleon skin%0a%3c     63-68      59-64     55-59      Cold sensitivity/cold tolerance [*1]%0a%3c     69-74      65-70     60-64      Colour blind%0a%3c     75-80      71-76     65-69      Heat sensitivity/heat tolerance [*1]%0a%3c     81-86      77-82     70-74      Infrared vision%0a%3c     87-91      83-88     75-84      Night vision%0a%3c     92         89-91     85-89      Poison%0a%3c     93         92        90         Radiation tolerance%0a%3c     94         93        91         Radio communication%0a%3c     95         94        92         Radio sense%0a%3c     96         95        93         Ranged weapon%0a%3c     97         96        94         Regeneration%0a%3c     98         97-98     95-97      Sonar [*2]%0a%3c     99         99        98         Suckers (wall climbing)%0a%3c     100        100       99         Vacuum tolerance%0a%3c     --         --        100        Web spinning%0a%3c %0a%3c     [*1: If you're creating an intelligent species for an already-generated%0a%3c     planet, the planet's surface temperature will affect the natives'%0a%3c     heat/cold tolerance.

PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE%0a%3c %0a%3c The psychological profile of an intelligent species is described by a set of six numbers: social, cooperation, aggression, exploration, technology, and art. Each runs from 0 to 100.%0a%3c %0a%3c Social: Indicates the degree of gregariousness and social organisation in their civilisation. A social rating of zero would indicate a totally solitary species with no social interaction at all; a social rating of 100 would indicate a hive-mind species with no concept of individual identity.  Some social contact is assumed to be required for the evolution of language and intelligence, so a social rating less than 5 is not allowed in this system.%0a%3c %0a%3c Cooperation: Indicates how willing they are to cooperate with other intelligent species. A cooperation rating of zero would indicate a totally xenophobic species that refuses to even recognise the existence of any other intelligent life; a cooperation rating of 100 would indicate a race with no sense of species identity at all, making no distinction between their own conspecifics and aliens.%0a%3c %0a%3c Aggression: Indicates how warlike they are, both among themselves and against other species. An aggression rating of zero would indicate a completely pacifist species that never fought anyone for any reason; an aggression rating of 100 would indicate a completely warlike species with no interest in any other activity. For obvious reasons there will be a negative correlation between the cooperation and aggression ratings (but not completely -- for example, a species that enjoyed fighting and frequently hired themselves out as mercenaries to anyone who needed soldiers might have a high rating in both areas, while a peaceful but isolationist species, such as Larry Niven's Puppeteers, would have a low rating in both).%0a%3c %0a%3c Exploration: Indicates their curiosity and interest in research and exploring the universe. An exploration rating of zero would indicate a species with no curiosity at all (since this seems incompatible with intelligence, a rating of less than 5 is not allowed); an exploration rating of 100 would indicate a species completely obsessed with exploration or science.%0a%3c %0a%3c Technology: Indicates their technological aptitude. A technology rating of zero would indicate a species with no technology of any kind; a technology rating of 100 would indicate a species obsessed with technology to the exclusion of anything else. There is a strong positive correlation between the exploration and technology ratings.%0a%3c %0a%3c Art: Indicates what part artistic activities play in their society. An art rating of zero would indicate a completely practical and utilitarian species, with no aesthetic sense at all (to humans they would seem cold and robotic); an art rating of 100 would indicate that aesthetic considerations completely dominated practical ones (this would not be a survival trait, which is why an art rating above 95 is not allowed). There is a negative correlation between the technology and art ratings.%0a%3c %0a%3c     Profile      Basic                            Modifiers      Allowed%0a%3c     element      die roll                                        range%0a%3c     -----------  -------------------------------  -------------  -------%0a%3c     Social       (2D6x10)+D10-25                  Herbivore +10  5-100%0a%3c                                                   Omnivore  0%0a%3c                                                   Carnivore -10%0a%3c     Cooperation  (2D6x10)+D10-25                  Herbivore 0    0-100%0a%3c                                                   Omnivore  +5%0a%3c                                                   Carnivore -5%0a%3c     Aggression   (2D6x10)+D10-(Cooperation/5)-15  Herbivore -10  0-100%0a%3c                                                   Omnivore  0%0a%3c                                                   Carnivore +10%0a%3c     Exploration  (2D6x10)+D10-25                  Herbivore -10  5-100%0a%3c                                                   Omnivore  +5%0a%3c                                                   Carnivore +5%0a%3c     Technology   (D6x10)+D10+(Exploration/2)-15   --             0-100%0a%3c     Art          (2D6x10)+D10-(Technology/5)-15   --             0-95%0a%3c %0a%3c If the result is outside the allowed range, roll again.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!! 7.4.
