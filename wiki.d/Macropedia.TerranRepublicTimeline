text=This is from an email I sent out in April to the main list giving a rough timeline of the formation and fall of the TerranRepublic.²²----²²Well, my RethTawmerikI article states that good ol' [[RethTawmerikI|Reth]] was²instrumental in getting the Republic formed, and we've established²almost since the beginning that [[RethTawmerikI|Reth]] with his buddy AlistairCormwite²were responsible for its demise.²²We know that:²²- The philosopher and journalist JanoosWelkred was instrumental in at²least elucidating the idea of a TerranRepublic as a way of bringing²together humanity after the long period of isolation during the Chronology/FirstDecline.²²- [[RethTawmerikI|Reth Tawmerik]] was an important supporter of the Republican movement,²and as a member of a very important family from the ImperialCoreWorlds²must have had a great deal of influence on convincing other powerful²interests to back it.²²- [[RethTawmerikI|Reth]] is also the first Prime Minister, though he only remains in that²position for a year, before becoming Minister of Defense for some²indeterminate amount of time.²²- We also know that [[RethTawmerikI|Reth Tawmerik]], after capturing MessenFremezulejo,²seems to have had a change of heart.
