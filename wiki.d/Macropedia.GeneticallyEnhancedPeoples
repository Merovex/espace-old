The [[Anthorph]]s are a genetically diverse people that are bound by some similiarities in culture, custom and faith.%0a%0aThere have been other populations of genetically enhanced peoples that are generally not classified as being [[Anthorph]]s.  Many of these are descendants of pre-Anthorph experiments, particularly during the Chronology/FirstExpanse.  There are records of many such experiments from this earliest period of space travel.  So-called Belters that lived in the rocky asteroid belt of the Terran system were said to have had alterations done to make living for extended periods in zero-g environments easier.  The descendants of these Belters still live today, most not having stood on a planetary surface in millennia.%0a%0aThere are rumors that the [[Imudring]] also experimented upon themselves.
