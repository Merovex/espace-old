text=%0aFighter%0aStrength: Soaking up damage%0aWeakness: Ships with shields and cannot move without hangers.%0aBuild: Tons of them!%0a%0aThis is by far the most cost effective unit in the game and should be the backbone of all your fleets. Basically, you want fighters to compose about half of your total fleet. Each base should have several thousand fighters guarding it. Each fleet should be at least half fighters. Often, you will want to attack an enemy fleet with a wave of fighters before hitting it with your big stuff (like if they have bombers – especially heavy bombers, or lots of other low shielded units). One thing you need to be aware of is that they cannot hurt anything with more than 4 shields (depending on tech levels of course). So do not attack anything above Heavy Cruisers with just fighters as you will lose them all. You would still, however, want to have lots of fighters in the fleet you use to take out the bigger ships as it will make it so you lose far fewer big ships (and win with the least credit amount of your units destroyed).%0a%0aBombers%0aStrength: Fairly Cost effective%0aWeakness: But fighters are better in most situations%0aBuild: Some%0a%0aBasically a fighter with twice the firepower – but at twice the cost. Their armor is the same as fighters though, so in most situations you are paying twice the cost for only half the benefit. You might find some situations, like against cruisers or heavy cruisers where they would be best to attack with. Watch out for battleships and higher as a few battleships can kill 20K of bombers.%0a%0aHeavy Bombers%0aStrength: Attacking medium sized ships%0aWeaknesses: Everything else%0aBuild: Some%0a%0aYou have 4 times the power, and twice the armor of a fighter – but at six times the cost. The only situation I can see where they would be most cost effective is against lone heavy cruisers.%0a%0aIon Bombers%0aStrength: Shielded units%0aWeaknesses: Anything else in the group you are attacking%0aBuild: rarely%0a%0aThe benefit is that half of their power goes through shields. Probably the ideal situation to build them would be: someone occupies your base and so you start producing a few fighters every hour to harass his RC and low level ships. This takes out more than they cost so eventually he moves away all the low level units and is just guarding you with some battleships or other shielded unit. Now, all it takes is three shipyards to pop out a group of ion bombers so you can through out a few of them and kill more than it costs to make them. A big dilemma you would then face is that he probably killed all your fleet and so any ion bombers you had left would be stuck and he would come back and kill them with fighters but you did do a good job annoying him so it was probably worth it.%0a%0aCorvette%0aStrength: Speed%0aWeakness: Not much better then a fighter%0aBuild: Some%0a%0aOften it is handy to have a group of 1000-2000 corvettes sitting on a jump gate. During a UC spawn you can get them places fast and pick up a few. Corvettes do not work against a Battleship or better though so you need to watch out. Having at least one fast attack group is often nice though. The bad thing is that other than speed they are only twice as good as a fighter but at four times the cost.%0a%0aRecycler%0aStrength: Making Money%0aWeaknesses: Fighting%0aBuild: Several hundred to go with each attack group%0a%0aEach one sitting on a debris pile will make 10 credits an hour on the half hour (until the debris is gone). This is usually necessary for you to get your losses back after taking a planet. Never attack with them and run if you see enemies coming.%0a%0aDestroyer%0aStrength: Not as bad as frigates%0aWeaknesses: Not as good as any bigger ships%0aBuild: Only before you can build cruisers%0a%0aThat pretty much sums it up. They are not as cost effective as other ships but as for a mobile force in your first few weeks they are probably the best thing you have.%0a%0aFrigate%0aStrength: Two hanger%0aWeaknesses: The developers bothered to make them%0aBuild: Never%0a%0aThe only good point is that they have two hanger spaces and are the first unit that can transport fighters. The problem is you would have to build so many of them to move enough fighters to be worth it that you would have been better off researching the techs to get carriers. They are less cost effective than Destroyers so you probably never want to build them.%0a%0aIon Frigate%0aStrength: Half their attack goes through Shields%0aWeaknesses: They were modeled after Frigates%0aBuild: Probably Never%0a%0aI have not run simulations with them so there might be a time when they would be the most cost effective unit, especially considering they can move fairly fast. But I doubt it. The situations are probably rare enough that you would be best not building them.%0a%0aScout Ships:%0aStrength: Super Fast%0aWeaknesses: Fighting%0aBuild: Some%0a%0aKnowing where the enemies are is vital. Scout ships are the best at scouting. Build ten of them and every few weeks sweep through your galaxy (using the menu this goes fast). They are not used for fighting all though they are useful for scout taps on an undefended base. A scout tap is when a scout ship is used to attack an undefended base to get credits. If you try a scout tap do not leave the ship there to occupy the base because all the owner has to do is build one fighter to take it out.%0a%0aCruisers%0aStrength: Possibly the all around best unit in the game%0aWeaknesses: Not many if any%0aBuild: Lots%0a%0aThey are the most cost effective unit in the game. They move a lot faster than Heavy Cruisers and Battleships which is a big plus. They kill the smaller units as well, if not better, then Battleships. They are not as good as Battleships for taking out Dreds or higher, but the amount of Dreds you will be facing for a while will probably low. So until there are large Dred fleets running around, you might want to stick with cruisers. (Most BORG attacks consist of a ton of fighters and a ton of cruisers; expect others to start copying this. If we can find a good counter to this combo, it will probably pay in the long run).%0a%0aCarrier%0aStrength: Hangers%0aWeaknesses: Fighting%0aBuild: Enough to transport a huge number of fighters%0a%0aNot quite as cost effective at transporting as Fleet Carriers, so if you can build fleet carriers build them instead. The one benefit they do have over fleet carriers is they are faster. Until they you can build fleet carriers (or at planets with less shipyards) build enough carriers to transport your large fleet of fighters. Be warned, always move carriers before attacking (move them and after the attack recall them). Kill enemy carriers where you can and retreat yours from their attacks.%0a%0aHeavy Cruisers%0aStrength: Good all around%0aWeaknesses: Slower then Cruisers%0aBuild: Fine to build but not necessary%0a%0aThey are the units between Battleships and Cruisers. They are by no means bad to build but I tend to think that cruisers are a bit better at some things and Battleships a bit better at others so you are better off just building them. Once you get to a point where you have to deal with Dreads and Titans the Heavy Cruiser might be the best choice at this point in the game. Cruisers will be less effective against Dreds which people are going to be getting more and more of. HC will be less effective than Battleships against ships larger than Dreds, but until then, the Speed benefit of HC might make them the thing to be building now.%0a%0aBattleships%0aStrength: Best Strong Unit%0aWeaknesses: slower then smaller units%0aBuild: Lots%0a%0aThey are a bit slower then the cruisers which hurts. Per credit, you get about half the armor and power as cruisers. Against many of the smaller units you would be better off building cruisers. Against battleships, however, they are about equal cost to cruisers and with Dreds or above, they are better. You may want to concentrate on the cruisers until there are more big units in the game but you cannot really go wrong with Battleships. The more I look at it though, the more I am thinking it might be best just to go for the Cruisers at this point in the game. (Versus Dreds, Battleships and Heavy Cruisers are about equally cost effective and Heavy Cruisers are Faster).%0a%0aFleet Carriers%0aStrength: Hanger%0aWeaknesses: Fighting%0aBuild: Enough to transport your fighter squad%0a%0aThey are slightly less costly per hanger space then carriers, but are slower (if you went the Cruiser route as your attacking fleet, you might want to go for carriers as fleet carriers will slow you down). Overall though, they are better than carriers so build them instead.%0a%0aDreadnoughts:%0aStrength: Intimidation%0aWeakness: Speed%0aBuild: ?%0a%0aThe verdict is still out for me on these. They will probably become better once there are even more big ships in the game but not many people have anything bigger than this at the moment unless you are in the lower galaxies. So right now they are not any better then Battleships. They are so slow that I just left them behind. They are nice to have sit there and occupy people with that cannot build anything that hurt them. And they are scary to see coming. But so far I am not convinced that they are worth building.%0a%0aConclusion:%0a%0aYou want your defenses to be strong turrets and fighters. You want your attacking fleet to be lots of fighters and then a ton of Cruisers, Heavy Cruisers, or maybe Battleships. Here is a good battle report showing what this type of fleet can do, look at the total unit costs of what was destroyed and then keep in mind that he had command centers boosting him as well.
