Aspect Chart ||||||||||||%0a|| Aspect || Poor || Medocre || Fair || Good || Great ||%0a|| ____________________ || O || O || O || O || O ||%0a%0a!! Action Resolution%0a%0aThere are three essential ways to resolve most actions: simple, complex and conflict.%0a%0a!!! Simple Actions%0a%0aA '''simple action''' is one where a character's aspect is higher than the difficulty of the action itself. In game terms, the situation is one that is considered so routine to the character's aspect that random variations should not be a consideration.%0a%0a!!! Complex Actions%0a%0a'''Complex Actions''' occur when the character's aspect is lower than the difficulty of the task attempted. Dice rolls are made to resolve these actions because these situations are more complicated than those with which the character is accustomed to dealing. %0a%0a'''Complex Action Skill Check.''' To resolve these actions, the player selects the relevant aspect and explains to the GM why that aspect should be used. Once the player and GM agree, then the player rolls 3dF and applies the result to the aspect. If the skill check result is equal or above the task's difficulty, then the character succeeds. Otherwise, the character fails. Either way, the GM should consider the degree of success or failure when determining the final results of a complex action%0a%0a!!! Conflicts%0a%0aWhen one or more characters are actively trying to resist a character's action, then a conflict has occurred. '''Conflicts''' are resolved the same as Complex actions, except that the other character's Aspect and skill check determine the difficulty of the action. This is the same method of resolving all forms of multi-character conflict--including combat. There are two ways to resolve conflicts: simultaneously, or alternating. Regardless of the method used, for a character to succeed in a conflict, the character must roll at least Poor and roll higher than the other character(s).%0a%0a'''Conflict Skill Check.''' To resolve a conflict, each character involved determines the relevant Aspect in consultation with the GM--as they would to resolve a Complex Action. Each character then rolls 3dF and adds the result to that Aspect's skill level. The character with the higher result wins if his result is Poor or higher. If the higher result is below Poor, then the character fails his conflict action. The difference between the winning roll and the losing roll is the '''relative degree of success.'''%0a%0a'''Strategy.'''  A character in a conflict can announce whether they are going to be defensive or aggressive in the conflict. If a character announces he will be defensive, then he will receive a +1 on his conflict skill check roll when defending, and a -1 on his roll as an aggressor. Alternatively, when a character announces he is being aggressive, then he receives a -1 when defending, and +1 when he is the aggressor.%0a%0a||! Strategy Modifiers ||||||%0a|| '''Position''' || '''Attack''' || '''Defense''' ||%0a|| Aggressive || +1 || -1 ||%0a|| Defensive || -1 || +1 ||%0a%0a'''Creativity.''' When a ''player'' describes his action in a very creative way, then he may also receive a +1 on his conflict skill check. However, when a player is poorly describing what his character is doing, or is otherwise inattentive to the game or creating unusual delays or disturbances, then his character receives a -1 on his conflict skill check. This modifier is accumulative with the strategy modifier.%0a%0a'''Use of Tools.''' If a character has a tool appropriate to the Aspect used in the conflict, then the GM may provide an additional +1 to his conflict skill check.%0a%0a'''Cinematic Conflict.''' When the character is involved in more cinematic conflict against a minion, the GM may prefer to use the Complex action resolution using the minion's skill level as the level of difficulty the character must beat to win. Unlike Simple actions, even if the minion's skill level is below the character's, a roll must be made. If the character loses, assume the minion has won that round and apply damage to the character based upon his relative degree of failure.%0a%0a!!! Alternating Conflict Resolution%0a%0a'''Alternating Conflict Resolution''' involves more dice rolling and takes a bit more time. However, it may be better suited to combat for some gaming groups than simultaneous. The general flow of alternating conflict resolution is to first determine initiative, then have each character resolve their conflicting action in order.%0a%0a'''Initiative''' is determined by the character with the higher Aspect, or the GM should allow the characters to roll a conflict skill check based on the appropriate Aspect to determine who goes first. If one character surprises the other, then naturally he should go first. When the conflict skill check is a tie, then the higher Aspect wins, or if the Aspects are the same, then the players roll again.%0a%0aOnce initiative is determined, then each character, in order of initiative, becomes the "aggressor."  The target of his conflict is the "defender." Each aggressor announces what he is trying to do. Each defender then announces what he will do to resist the aggressor. The players then conduct a Conflict Skill Check. After the aggressor's action is complete, the next character becomes the aggressor, and the process continues. Once all characters have been the aggressor, the round ends, and a new initiative round begins.%0a%0a!!! Simultaneous Conflict Resolution%0a%0a'''Simultaneous Conflict Resolution''' differs from alternating in that there is no initiative. Characters announce what they are doing and the appropriate Aspect as if they were resolving a Complex action. Once all character's actions are announced, each player then rolls a conflict skill check.%0a%0a!!! Damage%0a%0aCharacters receive damage whenever they are in conflict. Naturally, that damage is not always physical. A player records damage by temporarily reducing his character's Aspects. When all aspects have been reduced to Poor, the character is considered "incapacitated" or otherwise unable to continue the conflict. If the conflict is physical, then the victor can announce that he is killing his unconscious, vanquished foe.%0a%0a'''Recovery.''' Once the conflict is over, the character will usually immediately recover all his Aspect levels. If the damage is physical, this requires healing (which is always a Complex action). If the situation producing a conflict remains, then the character recovers only half his lost Aspect levels until the GM announces otherwise.%0a%0a>>example%3c%3c%0aThe Blind Kung-Fu master and his former pupil, Blind Evil Kung-Fu master are in a mass melee as their acolytes are also involved in the fight. After several rounds of fighthing, the Blind Kung-Fu master has lost the conflict and has fallen unconscious. His evil former pupil leaves him and continues fighting the Blind master's acolytes. Because the melee continues, the Blind Master can only recover half of his Aspect levels. Also, because he was physically injured, he must announce a relevant Aspect and conduct a Complex skill check to recover these Aspect levels. If the fight were over and the Blind Master was no longer in danger, then he could recover all the Aspect levels after a healing check. The GM may also want to impose a time restriction because of the physical nature of the injury.%0a>>%3c%3c
