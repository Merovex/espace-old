diff:1104446173:1103063154:=3,5c3,7²< '''Cosmology''' is the study of the large-scale structure and history of E-Space. For our purposes, this section discusses the various scientific assumptions we chose to help validate our setting. Most of this deals with superluminal, faster-than-light, travel as our present understanding of physics would seem to deny us this feat.²< ²< We chose an understanding of the BraneTheory as a plausible way of explaining how superluminal travel was possible. From that, we discuss BraneHopping, which translates Brane Theory into action. Finally, MagneticMonopoles are the material that makes superluminal travel work.²\ No newline at end of file²---²> BraneTheory²> ²> BraneHopping²> ²> MagneticMonopoles²\ No newline at end of file²
