text=(:*toc:)%0a%0aThere are few things that test you manhood like facing down an enemy on the field of battle. It takes rigorous training and discipline to become an honored warrior on the field. Work hard enough and you will find people know your name, and it has become synonymous with dignity, honor, and fair play.%0a%0aYeah, if you're looking for that shinizle, you're totally in the wrong place. I'm going to teach you to sneak up on your opponent in the dark, suckerpunch him, and gut him from crotch to sternum so you can play with his glistening entrails. Fingerpainting with your enemy's viscera while laughing hysterically is much more intimidating. Just ask the British how well fair play worked for them in the American Revolutionary War.%0a%0aBefore you start pillaging and burning you must learn somethings about%0ayour weapons and it's usage.%0a%0aShip Roles: Not all ships are made equal%0a========================================%0a%0aOne of the problems with balanced fleet doctrine is that it tends to%0amake people think they need to use ships that they have no need for in a%0afleet, giving their enemies an opportunity to destroy them more%0aefficiently. Balance is good, yes, but that does mean you should be%0abuilding frigates and including them in your fleets to disperse the%0adamage. Let's take a look at all of your units and their applications.%0aWhile some units are better than others, most have something they do%0awell.%0a%0a%0a'''Fighters.''' These are the staple of all fleets in AE---defense, offense, everything. Fighters are the single most efficient ship in the game. The damage they absorb per credit is unparalleled. That makes fighters your #1 unit for use as cannon fodder. When we say you can never have too many fighters, we're being quite literal. A fleet that runs out of fighters will take far higher losses, and can be defeated in detail for obscene exchange rates by anyone who manages to catch them. Build thousands for base defense, and then keep building them for use with offensive fleets. You go through fighters at an obscene rate because fighters are basically designed to die. Application of fighter waves in combat can totally change your exchange rate for the better.%0a%0a'''Bombers.''' Same armor as fighters with twice the firepower and twice the cost. These are less efficient, but still make for pretty efficient meat. Their ability to harm cruisers makes them especially handy. Don't go overboard with Bombers, but they make a good addition to any fleet that needs to absorb a lot of damage, or one that's hitting a large group of cruisers. Since most people use a lot of cruisers, bombers can be very useful.%0a%0a'''Heavy Bombers (HBs).''' Heavy Bombers pack enough punch to take out main fleet units---Cruisers and Heavy Cruisers---but they're vulnerable and expensive, as well. Heavy Bombers are best used in waves after you have used fighter waves to destroy the enemy's unshielded units. Heavy Bombers are inefficient against unshielded units, and therefore should not be used in main fleet engagements. Enemy fighters will cut them to ribbons. HBs are also the best ships for breaking occupations if you have a proper amount of Command Centers.%0a%0a'''Ion Bombers (IBs).''' Double the price of Heavy Bombers, with the same power and armor. All they gain is one point of shielding, which does practically nothing for their survivability, and their weapons become Ion based, so 50%25 penetrates shielding. Oh, yay. These things suck. They're so expensive that they're not even efficient in waves. If you send a wave of Ion Bombers against capital ships of equal value---be they cruisers, HCs, or BBs---it's impossible for the Ion Bombers to come out ahead in the exchange. The first ship class they can attack efficiently is Dreadnoughts, and that's only barely. Bigger ships are vastly more efficient, so don't waste your money on these.%0a%0a'''Corvettes.''' Corvettes are extremely handy because they're extremely fast. I don't include Corvettes in battle fleets, personally. They can be used as meat with the same efficiency as bombers, but they're too useful in their other applications to waste them as meat when you don't have to. I keep Corvette fleets of 500 or so at jumpgates for recycler hunting and/or reinforcement of damaged fleets that are almost out of fighters. They're fast enough to make excellent raiders, and that speed also makes them great to use as emergency meat. Fighters are twice as efficient, but if you don't have enough and you've got a fleet that's about to get hit, get your Corvettes there instead.%0a%0a'''Recyclers (RCs).''' These are not combat units, but that doesn't mean you don't need them. You need a ton. Resource denial is key to waging war. You should probably have at least 1000 for effective hit-and-run tactics. This will be covered in another volume.%0a%0a'''Destroyers (DDs, tin cans).''' This is your first Plasma unit. Since the bulk of your fleet should be Plasma units, your Plasma research should be high, making Destroyers even more handy. They can be used as a combination attack/meat ship in attack fleets, but their low survivability makes them poor units to include in fleets that will spend much time in enemy territory. A few fighter waves can wipe them out very efficiently if you're caught while you're not online. Destroyers are the best ship for efficiently killing Cruisers, but the fact that Destroyers are unshielded means they're vulnerable to meat ships. If you find some naked Cruisers, wipe them out with Destroyers. I like to keep a fairly large Destroyer unit on standby at my jumpgates to facilitate rapid reinforcement of my bases if I see an enemy fleet coming. Destroyers pack a punch sufficient to damage Cruisers and HCs, which are primary fleet units. When you have Command Centers behind them, they play hell with enemy ratios, therefore creating larger debris piles over your planets. Handy! They're also fast enough for some Recycler hunting.%0a%0a'''Frigates.''' These ships are handy for one thing: telling whether or%0anot a player is an idiot mouthbreather. If he's got a lot of Frigates,%0achances are you're dealing with a noob. '''ATTENTION: FRIGATES SUCK. DON'T BUILD THEM. EVER.'''%0a%0a'''Ion Frigates.''' Just like Frigates, only with Ion weapons and one point of shielding to go with a price tag 50%25 higher than it's counterpart. Think that makes them better? Not really.%0a%0a'''Carriers.''' All those fighters don't do much good without a way to%0aget them around. That's what these are for. They have less survivability%0athan Fleet Carriers, but they're also faster. I keep a group at my%0ajumpgates for rapid reinforcement. '''ALWAYS RETREAT YOUR CARRIERS BEFORE ATTACKING.''' If I see you attacking with Carriers, I'm going to hit you in the brainpan with a salmon. You have been warned.%0a%0a'''Cruisers.''' This is the most efficient capital ship in the game. Build lots and lots of them. At least 35%25 of my total fleet strength is Cruisers. (Fighters are another 35%25 or so.) Cruisers are the most efficient ship for taking out anything up to Dreadnoughts (although Heavy Cruisers are more efficient against Dreadnoughts if they have fighters accompanying them). Cruisers are also the most efficient way to take out Planetary Rings, but it takes a whole lot of them. Make sure you have enough. Cruisers should be the backbone of your main battle fleets.%0a%0a'''Heavy Cruisers (HCs).''' The only thing HCs can't hurt is a Death Star. HCs are handy against the big stuff, but I don't use them in main fleet formations unless I'm attacking something with BBs or higher. HCs are fairly efficient, but Cruisers will get you better ratios. HCs are great for taking out BBs and above, and as a bonus, they have enough shielding to be effectively immune to fighters, unless they have CCs behind them. HCs can be included in main battle fleets if you don't mind taking something of a ratio hit.%0a%0a'''Battleships (BBs).''' The sad fact of AE is that the bigger the ships get, the less efficient they get. Every ship is vulnerable to smaller ships. That holds true for Battleships as well. The efficiency drop from HCs to BBs is huge. Most people have far too many. Still, Battleships have their uses. For taking out Levis and Death Stars, this is the most efficient ship. Battleships are also immune to fighters, making them a good ship for taking out weakly defended planets or for holding an occupation. Battleships are poor ships to include in most battle fleets due to their terrible inefficiency against Cruisers/HCs (which is what most enemy fleets are built around).%0a%0a'''Fleet Carriers (FCs).''' FCs sacrifice speed for survivability. They have strong enough shields to shield-rape small units. If you have a calculator and you are very careful, it's possible to include FCs in attacks to improve ratios. This is dangerous, though. Don't do it if you're not experienced. You should have lots of FCs to move all your fighters around.%0a%0a'''Dreadnoughts (DNs).''' The bigger you get, the less efficient you get. The big stuff is best used against things that can't hurt it. The strength of these units is their shields. They're great for taking out bases that have defenses weaker than Disruptors, so long as there aren't fleet units big enough to have a chance at taking you down. Dreadnoughts can make a fair addition to a combat fleet if A) you're fighting things that won't be able to kill one, given the dispersion of damage amongst your units and B) you're prepared to slow your entire fleet down in order to include them. If you might lose one, you're better off leaving it out. If you can safely add one without losing it, feel free; it'll soak some damage away from your other units.%0a%0a'''Titans.''' This is the first unit with high enough shields to shield-rape Cruisers. That makes them very handy. On the downside, these things are slower than zombies playing Monopoly. Seriously, slooooooooooooow. HCs will kill them efficiently if you hit them with enough. BBs will kill them less efficiently, but require less bulk. Something like 130 HCs will kill a Titan, tech dependent, but it only takes about 20 BBs. The HCs should get about a 2:1 ratio, while the BBs will get less than 1.5:1. Titans are great to send out solo to smash bases with less than rings.%0a%0aI'm not even going to cover bigger things, because if you have them, you've been around more than long enough to know what to do with them, I would hope.%0a%0aHere are the most important parts for review:%0a%0a* Fighters and Cruisers should be the bulk of your fleet.%0a* Keep enough HCs around to deal with the big stuff, with more than that if you want to use them in main fleets.%0a* Don't build Frigates, Ion Frigates, or Ion Bombers unless you're sustained serious head injuries and you tend to drool a lot.%0a* Bigger isn't always better. The bigger you get, the less efficient you get. Don't build too much of the big stuff.%0a%0aThis concludes volume one, kiddies! Now that you know what ships are good for what, you should have some idea of what to build.%0a%0aFleet Doctrine%0a==============%0a%0aNow that you have a decent grasp on the roles of your combat units, it's time to see how these varying roles affects your fleet composition. There are three main types of combat doctrine you will so your opponents using: balanced fleet doctrine, efficiency doctrine, and what I call e-p*n*s doctrine. That's how I think of them, anyway. In the case of e-p*n*s doctrine, it's not really a doctrine at all; it's a fallacious belief that bigger is better. A lot of people are entirely too top-heavy, and since the most expensive ships are generally the least efficient, you get huge kill ratios from them.%0a%0a'''Efficiency Doctrine.''' Efficiency Doctrine is basically just balanced doctrine evolved. Under balanced doctrine, you should have equal armor values of different units. That's all well and good, but against a thinking opponent, your fleets can be dismantled easily. The problem with balanced doctrine is that it frequently leads people to build less efficient ship types to mix into their fleets to soak damage from other types of ships. Against someone fighting efficiently, you're going to get owned.%0a%0aDismantling a Balanced Fleet%0a----------------------------%0a%0aLet's take the example from the Art of War post. Your balanced fleet looks like this:%0a%0a[@%0a1 Dreadnought = 512 Armor%0a4 Battleships = 512 Armor%0a16 Heavy Cruisers = 768 Armor%0a32 Cruisers = 768 Armor%0a96 Destroyers = 768 Armor%0a192 Corvettes = 768 Armor%0a192 Heavy Bomber's = 768 Armor%0a384 Bomber's = 768 Armor%0a384 Fighter's = 768 Armor%0a@]%0a%0aThe total credit value of this fleet is 51,600 credits. (I'm leaving out the Fleet Carriers since they're not intended as combat units if it can be avoided.) Now, let's see how this balanced fleet fares against an equal-value fleet of Fighters and Cruisers (transports not included) with some basic fighter wave tactics.%0a%0aLet's say this is the other fleet:%0a%0a[@%0a3120 Fighters%0a180 Cruisers%0a@]%0a%0aThat's it. No frills. We'll assume equal tech levels for both fleets. These two fleets aren't going to clash directly, though. The attacking fleet of Cruisers/Fighters will first perform a fighter drop to take out the unshielded units.%0a%0a[@%0a2300 Fighters%0a%0avs.%0a%0a1 Dreadnought%0a4 Battleships%0a16 Heavy Cruisers%0a32 Cruisers%0a96 Destroyers%0a192 Corvettes%0a192 Heavy Bomber's%0a384 Bomber's%0a384 Fighter's%0a@]%0a%0aAfter the fighter wave, the balanced fleet is left with this:%0a%0a[@%0a1 Dreadnought%0a4 Battleships%0a16 Heavy Cruisers%0a32 Cruisers%0a@]%0a%0aWhoops! Not so balanced anymore. Bring in the Cruisers, and the formerly balanced fleet gets cut to ribbons.%0a%0a[@%0a820 Fighters%0a180 Cruisers%0a%0avs.%0a%0a1 Dreadnought%0a4 Battleships%0a16 Heavy Cruisers%0a32 Cruisers%0a%0a=%0a%0a252 Fighters%0a137 Cruisers%0a%0avs.%0a%0a0.1 Battleship%0a0.69 Dreadnought%0a@]%0a%0aOne more attack, and the assault force is left with 155 Fighters and 129 Cruisers. Total losses: 25025. Enemy losses: 51600. Voila! 2:1 ratio.%0a%0aThis is the problem with balanced doctrine. If you use a lot of%0adifferent unit types, it does in fact disperse the damage across them.%0aThe problem is, any ''unshielded unit is vulnerable to fighters'', which are the most efficient unit in the game. Use a battle calculator to find how many fighters you need to attack with in one wave to destroy all the unshielded units. Drop that many and no more; overkill just wastes fighters and ruins your ratios as the enemy's shielded units kill the extra fighters with practically no losses. Once the enemy's unshielded units are gone, you send in the Cruisers---which are the most efficient ship to kill the shielded units---with the remaining fighters as a meatshield. By using only your most efficient units, you come out well ahead in the exchange.%0a%0aThe spirit of balanced doctrine, though, is that you should have enough meat to protect your larger ships. This is an important concept. If you attacked with 200 Cruisers and 20 Fighters after the enemy had lost their unshielded units, you would finish the same fight with nothing but 121 Cruisers, for 27400 in losses and a slightly weaker ratio. No matter what your fleet composition is, you should always make sure you have enough of your most efficient ships to soak damage from the less efficient.%0a%0aThis goes back to the idea that you can never have too many fighters. If you're running a battle calculator and you come out of a fight with 0 fighters, you don't have enough. You should always end up with some fighters remaining because if you run out, the damage they would have absorbed is being transferred to your more expensive ships.%0a%0aEfficiency FTW%0a--------------%0a%0aWith Fighters being the most efficient unshielded unit and Cruisers%0abeing the most efficient shielded unit, the two together make the most%0awell-rounded combat fleet in the game. If you have good balance between%0acruisers and fighters, your fleet has no significant weakness. Fighter%0awaves meet with a negative exchange ratio. Attacking with Destroyers%0agets about a 2:1 ratio against naked Cruisers, but the Fighters get%0aabout 2.5:1 against Destroyers, so the two together cover one another's%0aweaknesses.%0a%0aIf faced with a fleet of Cruisers and Fighters, you've got to take poor%0aratios to get rid of the fighters before you can get good ratios on the%0aCruisers, unless you've got a Levi or something to shield-rape the%0aCruisers into submission. The best you can do is eat the bad ratios%0aagainst the fighters be dropping in a wave of your own fighters and then%0afollow up with Destroyers for a 2:1 ratio if you're capable. You're%0ausually not able to manage that, so you may as well just run into them%0awith your own Cruiser/Fighter unit for even odds and let the debris%0acompensate for your lack of winning ratio.%0a%0aIn order to put together efficient fleets, you need to know your target.%0aCruisers and Fighters are usually the most efficient fleet. Bear in%0amind, you should have Carriers/Fleet Carriers to ferry around fighters;%0awhile Cruisers can carry four fighters each, that's not nearly enough%0afor long-term operations. Fighters are disposable, so keep plenty in%0asupply. Heavy Cruisers are more efficient against everything up to%0aTitans and Leviathans, and close to equal with Cruisers in efficiency%0aagainst Dreadnoughts. Unshielded units are always vulnerable to fighter%0awaves, so leaving these as part of a combat fleet in enemy territory is%0aasking for poor ratios. (They have their place, certainly; we covered%0athat in Volume I.) Using unshielded units in an assault can be fine,%0adon't get me wrong; in the event that you're using a large-scale fleet%0awith many unit types, a la balanced doctrine, having extra ship types to%0abalance the damage out can save your ratios. Most of the time, though,%0ayou should have that many unit types in your fleets because it forces%0ayou to use less efficient means of soaking damage.%0a%0aEfficiency doctrine is just about taking balanced doctrine and distilling it down to its core. Balanced doctrine seeks to achieve efficiency by using cheaper units to protect the larger units. Efficiency doctrine eliminates the less efficient units from the fleet entirely, distilling attack fleets down to their most efficient elements. That doesn't mean you should build nothing but Fighters and Cruisers, but it does mean they should make up a very large portion of your fleet. Make sure you have a strong Heavy Cruiser contingent for the big stuff. Keeping a few BBs and DNs around can be handy, but don't go overboard with the large units.%0a%0aThat's all for now, people. By now you should be on your way to becoming a force to be reckoned with. Keep your eyes peeled for more.%0a%0aYou have some idea how to put fleets together, so let's cover how to use them.%0a%0aI live by a simple motto: "That which does not kill me has made a grave tactical error." If the enemy is not putting you under pressure, he's letting you take initiative and dictate the pace and the stakes of the conflict. Accept that offer.%0a%0aStrategic Thinking%0a==================%0a%0aEvery now and then, a guild in AstroEmpires gets the genius idea to%0aturtle simultaneously during a major war. The idea may look good on the%0asurface---base defenses and Command Centers vastly increase exchange%0arates, so why not keep your fleet above your planets where they can reap%0athe benefits? Surely you can break the enemy's back this way!%0a%0aWell, it's an idea. Granted, it's one that goes against thousands of%0ayears of military strategy. It may look good on paper, but the fact is%0ainitiative is too valuable an asset in war. If you sit back and wait for%0ayour enemy to come to you, he will. And he'll do it with overwhelming%0aforce. You'll get good exchange rates, and then your enemy will scoop%0aall the debris and turn it into fleet to replace his losses. Meanwhile,%0aall your fleet was at home where it just got smashed, so you have no%0ahope of liberating your bases. Because your enemy was under no pressure,%0ahe could amass a force to come after you at his leisure. It's the same%0areason hackers are always one step ahead of security: It's impossible to%0acreate an impregnable defense. If you have a determined enemy who knows%0awhat he's dealing with---all he has to do is sit a scout somewhere in%0athe region to watch you---then he can figure out exactly what he needs%0ato break your defenses. Given time, he'll put together a fleet to break%0ayou, and he doesn't have to worry about uncovering one of his systems to%0ado it because he's not under any pressure.%0a%0aA winning strategy is one that ''takes the initiative''. Aggression forces%0ayour opponent to worry about protecting his own assets. Half the reason%0aI'm riding people about defenses is so they will have bases that their%0aenemies are afraid to attack. Some people would rather look for another%0atarget than attack a base with two sets of disruptors and deflectors.%0aOnce you get p-rings and p-shields, people really hate messing with you.%0aIf your enemy is weak or timid, he'll stall forever before attacking%0ayou, waiting to get more fleet online to make sure they have%0aoverwhelming odds. Hit one of his bases during this span, and he may%0anever hit you back if you're well defended. If you just stepped up and%0ahit him in the mouth, he'll be too worried about leaving himself open to%0aanother attack to go on the offensive. You've got him thinking about how%0ayou hurt him, not about how he can hurt you.%0a%0aConditioning Your Enemy%0a-----------------------%0a%0aRemember how I said fingerpainting with your enemy's viscera while laughing hysterical is more intimidating than being know as an honorable warrior? Well, we're in the strategy section now, so let's start getting into that. When a war first kicks off, I like to employ a tactic that I call Pavlov's Rapetrain. The first enemy aggression will almost invariably occur against the weakest friendly bases in the area. These are simply attacks of opportunity. Soft targets provide an easy economy boost for the enemy. Everyone does it.%0a%0aStill, attacking a soft target shows initiative, and that's something we don't want to see out of our opponents. On top of that, it may sometimes bely an unwillingness to attack except from a position of extreme superiority. I say sometimes, because that's not necessarily the case; I hit soft targets early, too, when I know where they are. It's good business; it boosts your economy, you can get in and out quickly because there won't be much debris to scoop, and it immediately lets your opponent know you're willing to dance. The enemy is sending a message. Pavlov's Rapetrain is about replying to that message.%0a%0aIt's fairly simple---first one to show aggression rides the rapetrain. It%0adoesn't matter how well-defended he is. It doesn't matter if there are%0asofter targets around. The soft targets don't pose a threat. Not only%0ahave they shown no aggression, but they're also easy meat for whenever%0ayou get around to them. Focus on the enemy aggressors, and knock them%0aback on their heels. Pick one of their production bases---as a bonus,%0athese are frequently jumpgate worlds, and often house a large fleet if%0ait's not out on assault duty---and smash it. These are usually well%0adefended worlds, and you will take significant losses in order to break%0athem. If you don't have enough fleet to take it without being crippled,%0acoordinate with guildmates. Don't break yourself to send a message, but%0aif you don't have enough fleet to take one base without breaking%0ayourself, you really aren't ready for war yet to begin with.%0a%0aThis is all about sending a message back to him. You want to show him%0athat no matter how well defended he is, he always has to worry about you%0ahitting him. Don't let him feel safe simply because he has p-rings up.%0aRoll in with a thousand cruisers and show him how little you worry about%0ahis rings. You want him to worry about sending his fleet to the front%0abecause he may need it back home.%0a%0aNow, while preparing for the attack, coordinate with any guildmates in%0ayour area to locate and destroy each of his bases. If he hits one soft%0atarget and suddenly finds himself ass deep in debris that the enemy is%0afeeding on, commanding an empire of ruined planets, chances are he's%0agoing to be less aggressive in the future. You want to teach him that%0aaggression is dangerous, and force him into a timid, defensive mindset.%0aYou're also taking the first aggressors of the war and making an example%0aof them. I employed this tactic in the Beta War, and the aggressor that%0aI hit never assaulted one of our planets in that galaxy again. Only one%0amember of his guild ever attacked one of our planets in that galaxy%0aafter those attacks. You want his guild to see the price he pays for%0aaggression. The psychological effect you have on your opponents may be%0aenough to take the initiative from them permanently.%0a%0aThe easy targets are probably still going to be easy targets later.%0aTeach the more active and aggressive players what happens when they%0aattack. If you can get them to fallaciously think they weren't defending%0atheir planets well enough, they'll keep more of their fleet at home%0awhere you don't have to worry about it.%0a%0aTempo and Resource Denial%0a-------------------------%0a%0aThere's more to war in AstroEmpires than just destroying the other guy's%0afleet and getting good ratios. You can get 3:1 ratios all day long and%0astill let your enemy come out ahead if you neglect the debris. '''ATTACKING AN ENEMY, SMASHING THEIR FLEET, AND THEN MOVING ON AND LEAVING THE DEBRIS BEHIND IS NOT A VICTORY'''. This is a very important concept. It may%0alook like you just won, but if you let him have the debris, you haven't%0areally done anything because all that debris is going to be converted%0aback into fleet. Fleet replacement is absolutely essential in a%0aprotracted engagement; it's very possible for your fleet numbers to%0aactually go up during a war if you're getting maintaining good ratios%0aand getting most of the debris.%0a%0aBecause of this dynamic, the pace of your offensive is limited by your%0aability to clean up debris. The more recyclers you have, the faster you%0acan move along. If you've got 1000 cruisers just waiting to tear your%0aenemy apart, you had better not have neglected to build recyclers to%0afollow in their wake. Simply smashing the enemy's fleet and moving along%0aonly costs him the time it takes to rebuild; the debris left by the%0acombined losses of the engagement will pay for most of the damage.%0a%0a'''Caveat:''' That doesn't mean that raiding tactics are worthless. The%0aeconomy hit that is dealt to planet when it is occupied is significant,%0aand it takes a long time to fully regenerate. If you don't have the%0aability to lock down the area and harvest the debris before moving%0aalong, but your combat fleet has plenty of fight left in it, employing%0ablitzkrieg tactics and rapidly hitting several of an enemy's bases can%0adeal a massive blow to his economy, even if you're not occupying those%0abases in the long-term. The problem with this is even if he doesn't have%0athe recyclers available to get the debris himself, he's going to call%0aguildies in to feast, and large amounts of debris may go into the hands%0aof dangerous players.%0a%0aYou don't have to get every last scrap of debris you create, but you%0awant to get as much as possible even if you don't need the money. Notice%0athat this section isn't called Resource Harvesting. Resource denial%0ameans just that---you're not gathering it because you need it; you're%0agathering it because your opponent does, and he can't have it if you get%0ait first.%0a%0aTo this end, you should have a large recycler fleet. If you have%0aanything less than 1000 recyclers, you shouldn't plan to launch any kind%0aof fast-moving offensive without debris-collecting support form your%0aguildmates. If you have priority targets to hit and you made too big of%0aa mess to clean up and move to the next target quickly, call in your%0aguildies. Don't be selfish with debris; the economic boost is nice, but%0akeeping it away from the enemy is nicer. If you can't empty the debris%0apile yourself in a reasonable amount of time, call in backup. If you%0aknow you're going to be making a large mess in an assault or series of%0aassaults and you won't be able to get much of the debris, notify your%0aguildmates in the area before you launch your offensive so they can get%0arecyclers in a position to start eating debris as soon as possible. If%0ayou've got four guildmates in the area and each of you has 1000%0arecyclers, your combined RC fleets will harvest 50,000 credits worth of%0adebris per hour. Not only that, but it doesn't actually take an hour to%0aprocess debris; you only have to have your recyclers there for the%0adebris processing update, which comes at half past the hour. With good%0atiming, your vulnerable recyclers may only be available targets for a%0aminute or two, and then a huge chunk of debris is gone.%0a%0aDon't leave your recyclers stationary in enemy territory if you want to%0akeep them. They are priority targets for everyone, and you simply cannot%0aprotect them. Since they're unshielded units, fighter attacks or suicide%0aruns from Corvettes can wipe them out no matter how much additional%0afleet you have there to protect them.%0a%0aSpeaking of suiciding Corvettes, you should have a fleet on standby,%0aready to hunt down enemy recyclers whenever you spot them. I start%0abuilding more Corvettes any time my number of Corvettes in commission%0adrops below 1000. Corvettes are the fastest attack ship in the game,%0awhich makes them ideal for recycler hunting. Don't expect for your%0aCorvettes to survive an especially long time, though; if you find%0arecyclers in the middle of a large fleet, suicide enough Corvettes into%0athe fleet to kill the recyclers. Recyclers are always a priority target.%0aYou can take more time scooping debris if you destroy your opponent's%0aability to claim it.%0a%0aAdvanced Logistics%0a------------------%0a%0aKeeping the wheels of war turning requires good logistics. Part of that%0ais simply fleet replacement; while you're running amok and taking your%0aopponent's bases, your production queues should be running full bore%0aback home to keep your force levels the same (or to keep them on the%0arise). If things are going well and you're getting a lot of money from%0adebris, feel free to use Fast Production. You don't want to be sitting%0aon large stacks of cash if you get pillaged in war.%0a%0a>>note%3c%3c%0aNote: It's a common but incorrect belief that you lose money when you get pillaged. You don't. But the amount of cash you have on hand is part of the equation that determines how large the enemy pillage is, and you don't want to give him money if he hits you. Let him work for the debris like everyone else. Don't let him get 20k a pop instantly because you're sitting on too much money)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0aThe trickier part of logistics is resupply. The biggest limiting factor on a fleet's utility is its fighter supply. I cannot stress to you the ridiculous number of fighters you will go through in large engagements. I've dropped 6000 fighters just in one wave before. That's not even counting the fighters I used in the main fleet. If you're butting heads with large fleets, you will burn through fighters at a rate that rivals Lindsey Lohan's cocaine consumption. Once you're out of fighters, your fleet is vulnerable and your ratios are screwed. Rapid resupply is essential to continuing fleet function.%0a%0aThe ideal way to keep a fleet functioning is to keep it in supply. Fleet%0aCarriers are essential in combat fleets, with their high survivability%0asaving you tons of credits if you get caught flat-footed. They make poor%0aresupply vessels, though, because they're not as fast. Regular carriers%0aare far easier to kill, but are also 33%25 faster than Fleet Carriers.%0aThis makes them ideal as rear echelon units. They are never intended to%0asee combat. The idea is to dispatch your resupply carriers from a%0ajumpgate, drop off their fighter compliment for the FCs in the field to%0apick up, and then run them back home. In my opinion, Carriers should%0aonly be built for resupply purposes, or for when you need to get more%0afighter transport up fast. Fleet Carriers not only have higher%0asurvivability, but they also have more hangar space per credit spent%0athan Carriers do---even if it's not by much. Carriers serve a very%0aspecific role once you get FCs, and this is it. Keep plenty of fighters%0aat the jumpgate where the carriers are on standby, and trying to keep%0aenough bombers and heavy bombers on hand to fill your carriers for those%0ainstances when your enemy is vulnerable to a bomber or HB drop. Focus on%0afighters, though.%0a%0aSometimes you won't be able to resupply in time, and you've got the%0aenemy breathing down you neck. You may have taken a strategic point that%0ayou're not yet willing to vacate, but you're going to get pounded if you%0astay because you don't have enough meat left in the fleet. This is the%0aother function of Corvettes. Deploying from a decent jumpgate will%0aalmost invariably get Corvettes to your wounded fleet in time for battle%0aunless you've already let the enemy sneak up on you. Corvettes aren't as%0aefficient as meat as fighters are, but their armor-per-credit is equal%0ato bombers. Sometimes Corvettes are the best you can do, but they'll%0asave you thousands in fleet in the long run.%0a%0aIn the event that you have a large fleet in a relatively secure galaxy%0abut the neighboring galaxies have a smaller guild presence, you may want%0ato build up a cache of fighters at a friendly base in the neighboring%0agalaxy so that you have a resupply point for your fleet if you send%0areinforcements that way during war. This takes a lot of preparation%0atime, and means you'll have one less campaign fleet to work with. Still,%0ait's well worth it if you think you may have reason to send%0areinforcements to that galaxy in the future. Half the time, you'll eat%0athrough most of your fighter compliment in three or four strikes,%0aleaving your fleet to either make a stand and get crushed for lousy%0aratios or to head all the way back to your home galaxy to resupply. If%0ayou've built up a supply of fighters beforehand, your fleet will have%0amuch greater longevity before it is forced to withdraw.%0a%0aOkay, that's it for now, folks. I'll get to Volume IV in the near%0afuture. Pat yourself on the back if you actually read this hulking%0amonstrosity. All questions, comments, threats, random cursing, and%0aname-calling are welcome.  Back to top 	View user's profile Send private%0amessage 	 	%0a%0a----%0a%0aOkay so the exact change to the combat system is as such. Previously all%0aunits would spread out their damage evenly amongst all targets they%0acould do damage too, while only about 1%25 of the damage dealt by a stack%0awould cause damage to each stack of units it could not breech the%0ashields of. Confusing yes, I know. So I give you an example:%0a%0a>>example%3c%3c%0aYou have 1000 fighters and the enemy has 500 fighters, 300 Corvettes, 4%0aHeavy Cruisers and a set of Disruptor Turrets. Assuming base technology%0ayour fighters would do 2000 points of damage, 20 damage (1%25 of damage)%0awould hit the Disruptors, 20 damage (1%25) would hit the Heavy Cruisers,%0aand 980 damage (49%25) would hit each stack of Fighters and Corvettes.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0aThe change has been made now, that instead of 1%25, 5%25 of damage is sent%0aat each of the unit stacks that fighters could not otherwise damage.%0aThis reduces the effect of fighter drops because you'll need more%0afighters to destroy the same amount of unshielded ships as you%0apreviously needed.%0a%0aAs a result, I am recommending the building of heavy shielded ships,%0alike Heavy Cruisers and Battleships in your defensive screens, even if%0ayou have P-Rings. This will reduce the effectiveness of fighter drops%0asignificantly, as Heavy Cruisers and Battleships will absorb 5x more of%0athe firepower that would otherwise hit your smaller units under the old%0asystem. Whether the system is changed back or not is beyond my guess,%0abut for now, this is how it works. Also, take this into account when%0aattacking large stacks of fleet. Fighter drops will be ineffective%0aagainst planets with multiple layers of defenses (Ions, Photons,%0aDisruptors, D-shields, P-shields, Rings all absorb 5%25 of attack damage%0anow) and heavy and super capital ships.%0a%0a(:comment This page has been edited using Pywe:)

The damage they absorb per credit is unparalleled. That makes fighters your #1 unit for use as cannon fodder. When we say you can never have too many fighters, we're being quite literal. A fleet that runs out of fighters will take far higher losses, and can be defeated in detail for obscene exchange rates by anyone who manages to catch them. Build thousands for base defense, and then keep building them for use with offensive fleets. You go through fighters at an obscene rate because fighters are basically designed to die. Application of fighter waves in combat can totally change your exchange rate for the better.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Bombers.''' Same armor as fighters with twice the firepower and twice the cost. These are less efficient, but still make for pretty efficient meat. Their ability to harm cruisers makes them especially handy. Don't go overboard with Bombers, but they make a good addition to any fleet that needs to absorb a lot of damage, or one that's hitting a large group of cruisers. Since most people use a lot of cruisers, bombers can be very useful.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Heavy Bombers (HBs).''' Heavy Bombers pack enough punch to take out main fleet units---Cruisers and Heavy Cruisers---but they're vulnerable and expensive, as well. Heavy Bombers are best used in waves after you have used fighter waves to destroy the enemy's unshielded units. Heavy Bombers are inefficient against unshielded units, and therefore should not be used in main fleet engagements. Enemy fighters will cut them to ribbons. HBs are also the best ships for breaking occupations if you have a proper amount of Command Centers.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Ion Bombers (IBs).''' Double the price of Heavy Bombers, with the same power and armor. All they gain is one point of shielding, which does practically nothing for their survivability, and their weapons become Ion based, so 50%25 penetrates shielding. Oh, yay. These things suck. They're so expensive that they're not even efficient in waves. If you send a wave of Ion Bombers against capital ships of equal value---be they cruisers, HCs, or BBs---it's impossible for the Ion Bombers to come out ahead in the exchange. The first ship class they can attack efficiently is Dreadnoughts, and that's only barely. Bigger ships are vastly more efficient, so don't waste your money on these.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Corvettes.''' Corvettes are extremely handy because they're extremely fast. I don't include Corvettes in battle fleets, personally. They can be used as meat with the same efficiency as bombers, but they're too useful in their other applications to waste them as meat when you don't have to. I keep Corvette fleets of 500 or so at jumpgates for recycler hunting and/or reinforcement of damaged fleets that are almost out of fighters. They're fast enough to make excellent raiders, and that speed also makes them great to use as emergency meat. Fighters are twice as efficient, but if you don't have enough and you've got a fleet that's about to get hit, get your Corvettes there instead.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Recyclers (RCs).''' These are not combat units, but that doesn't mean you don't need them. You need a ton. Resource denial is key to waging war. You should probably have at least 1000 for effective hit-and-run tactics. This will be covered in another volume.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Destroyers (DDs, tin cans).''' This is your first Plasma unit. Since the bulk of your fleet should be Plasma units, your Plasma research should be high, making Destroyers even more handy. They can be used as a combination attack/meat ship in attack fleets, but their low survivability makes them poor units to include in fleets that will spend much time in enemy territory. A few fighter waves can wipe them out very efficiently if you're caught while you're not online. Destroyers are the best ship for efficiently killing Cruisers, but the fact that Destroyers are unshielded means they're vulnerable to meat ships. If you find some naked Cruisers, wipe them out with Destroyers. I like to keep a fairly large Destroyer unit on standby at my jumpgates to facilitate rapid reinforcement of my bases if I see an enemy fleet coming. Destroyers pack a punch sufficient to damage Cruisers and HCs, which are primary fleet units. When you have Command Centers behind them, they play hell with enemy ratios, therefore creating larger debris piles over your planets. Handy! They're also fast enough for some Recycler hunting.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Frigates.''' These ships are handy for one thing: telling whether or%0a%3c not a player is an idiot mouthbreather. If he's got a lot of Frigates,%0a%3c chances are you're dealing with a noob. '''ATTENTION: FRIGATES SUCK. DON'T%0a%3c BUILD THEM. EVER.'''%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Ion Frigates.''' Just like Frigates, only with Ion weapons and one point of shielding to go with a price tag 50%25 higher than it's counterpart. Think that makes them better? Not really.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Carriers.''' All those fighters don't do much good without a way to%0a%3c get them around. That's what these are for. They have less survivability%0a%3c than Fleet Carriers, but they're also faster. I keep a group at my%0a%3c jumpgates for rapid reinforcement. '''ALWAYS RETREAT YOUR CARRIERS%0a%3c BEFORE ATTACKING.''' If I see you attacking with Carriers, I'm going to hit you in the brainpan with a salmon. You have been warned.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Cruisers.''' This is the most efficient capital ship in the game. Build lots and lots of them. At least 35%25 of my total fleet strength is Cruisers. (Fighters are another 35%25 or so.) Cruisers are the most efficient ship for taking out anything up to Dreadnoughts (although Heavy Cruisers are more efficient against Dreadnoughts if they have fighters accompanying them). Cruisers are also the most efficient way to take out Planetary Rings, but it takes a whole lot of them. Make sure you have enough. Cruisers should be the backbone of your main battle fleets.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Heavy Cruisers (HCs).''' The only thing HCs can't hurt is a Death Star. HCs are handy against the big stuff, but I don't use them in main fleet formations unless I'm attacking something with BBs or higher. HCs are fairly efficient, but Cruisers will get you better ratios. HCs are great for taking out BBs and above, and as a bonus, they have enough shielding to be effectively immune to fighters, unless they have CCs behind them. HCs can be included in main battle fleets if you don't mind taking something of a ratio hit.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Battleships (BBs).''' The sad fact of AE is that the bigger the ships get, the less efficient they get. Every ship is vulnerable to smaller ships. That holds true for Battleships as well. The efficiency drop from HCs to BBs is huge. Most people have far too many. Still, Battleships have their uses. For taking out Levis and Death Stars, this is the most efficient ship. Battleships are also immune to fighters, making them a good ship for taking out weakly defended planets or for holding an occupation. Battleships are poor ships to include in most battle fleets due to their terrible inefficiency against Cruisers/HCs (which is what most enemy fleets are built around).%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Fleet Carriers (FCs).''' FCs sacrifice speed for survivability. They have strong enough shields to shield-rape small units. If you have a calculator and you are very careful, it's possible to include FCs in attacks to improve ratios. This is dangerous, though. Don't do it if you're not experienced. You should have lots of FCs to move all your fighters around.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Dreadnoughts (DNs).''' The bigger you get, the less efficient you get. The big stuff is best used against things that can't hurt it. The strength of these units is their shields. They're great for taking out bases that have defenses weaker than Disruptors, so long as there aren't fleet units big enough to have a chance at taking you down. Dreadnoughts can make a fair addition to a combat fleet if A) you're fighting things that won't be able to kill one, given the dispersion of damage amongst your units and B) you're prepared to slow your entire fleet down in order to include them. If you might lose one, you're better off leaving it out. If you can safely add one without losing it, feel free; it'll soak some damage away from your other units.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Titans.''' This is the first unit with high enough shields to shield-rape Cruisers. That makes them very handy. On the downside, these things are slower than zombies playing Monopoly. Seriously, slooooooooooooow. HCs will kill them efficiently if you hit them with enough. BBs will kill them less efficiently, but require less bulk. Something like 130 HCs will kill a Titan, tech dependent, but it only takes about 20 BBs. The HCs should get about a 2:1 ratio, while the BBs will get less than 1.5:1. Titans are great to send out solo to smash bases with less than rings.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> __Fighters.__ These are the staple of all fleets in AE---defense, offense, everything.

Bear in mind, you should have Carriers/Fleet Carriers to ferry around fighters; while Cruisers can carry four fighters each, that's not nearly enough for long-term operations. Fighters are disposable, so keep plenty in supply. Heavy Cruisers are more efficient against everything up to Titans and Leviathans, and close to equal with Cruisers in efficiency against Dreadnoughts. Unshielded units are always vulnerable to fighter waves, so leaving these as part of a combat fleet in enemy territory is asking for poor ratios. (They have their place, certainly; we covered that in Volume I.) Using unshielded units in an assault can be fine, don't get me wrong; in the event that you're using a large-scale fleet with many unit types, a la balanced doctrine, having extra ship types to balance the damage out can save your ratios. Most of the time, though, you should have that many unit types in your fleets because it forces you to use less efficient means of soaking damage.%0a> %0a217,253c180,185%0a%3c Every now and then, a guild in AstroEmpires gets the genius idea to%0a%3c turtle simultaneously during a major war.

Fleet%0a%3c Carriers are essential in combat fleets, with their high survivability%0a%3c saving you tons of credits if you get caught flat-footed. They make poor%0a%3c resupply vessels, though, because they're not as fast. Regular carriers%0a%3c are far easier to kill, but are also 33%25 faster than Fleet Carriers.%0a%3c This makes them ideal as rear echelon units. They are never intended to%0a%3c see combat. The idea is to dispatch your resupply carriers from a%0a%3c jumpgate, drop off their fighter compliment for the FCs in the field to%0a%3c pick up, and then run them back home. In my opinion, Carriers should%0a%3c only be built for resupply purposes, or for when you need to get more%0a%3c fighter transport up fast. Fleet Carriers not only have higher%0a%3c survivability, but they also have more hangar space per credit spent%0a%3c than Carriers do---even if it's not by much. Carriers serve a very%0a%3c specific role once you get FCs, and this is it. Keep plenty of fighters%0a%3c at the jumpgate where the carriers are on standby, and trying to keep%0a%3c enough bombers and heavy bombers on hand to fill your carriers for those%0a%3c instances when your enemy is vulnerable to a bomber or HB drop. Focus on%0a%3c fighters, though.%0a%3c %0a%3c Sometimes you won't be able to resupply in time, and you've got the%0a%3c enemy breathing down you neck. You may have taken a strategic point that%0a%3c you're not yet willing to vacate, but you're going to get pounded if you%0a%3c stay because you don't have enough meat left in the fleet. This is the%0a%3c other function of Corvettes. Deploying from a decent jumpgate will%0a%3c almost invariably get Corvettes to your wounded fleet in time for battle%0a%3c unless you've already let the enemy sneak up on you. Corvettes aren't as%0a%3c efficient as meat as fighters are, but their armor-per-credit is equal%0a%3c to bombers. Sometimes Corvettes are the best you can do, but they'll%0a%3c save you thousands in fleet in the long run.%0a%3c %0a%3c In the event that you have a large fleet in a relatively secure galaxy%0a%3c but the neighboring galaxies have a smaller guild presence, you may want%0a%3c to build up a cache of fighters at a friendly base in the neighboring%0a%3c galaxy so that you have a resupply point for your fleet if you send%0a%3c reinforcements that way during war. This takes a lot of preparation%0a%3c time, and means you'll have one less campaign fleet to work with. Still,%0a%3c it's well worth it if you think you may have reason to send%0a%3c reinforcements to that galaxy in the future. Half the time, you'll eat%0a%3c through most of your fighter compliment in three or four strikes,%0a%3c leaving your fleet to either make a stand and get crushed for lousy%0a%3c ratios or to head all the way back to your home galaxy to resupply. If%0a%3c you've built up a supply of fighters beforehand, your fleet will have%0a%3c much greater longevity before it is forced to withdraw.%0a%3c %0a%3c Okay, that's it for now, folks.

Previously all%0a%3c units would spread out their damage evenly amongst all targets they%0a%3c could do damage too, while only about 1%25 of the damage dealt by a stack%0a%3c would cause damage to each stack of units it could not breech the%0a%3c shields of. Confusing yes, I know. So I give you an example:%0a%3c %0a%3c >>example%3c%3c%0a%3c You have 1000 fighters and the enemy has 500 fighters, 300 Corvettes, 4%0a%3c Heavy Cruisers and a set of Disruptor Turrets. Assuming base technology%0a%3c your fighters would do 2000 points of damage, 20 damage (1%25 of damage)%0a%3c would hit the Disruptors, 20 damage (1%25) would hit the Heavy Cruisers,%0a%3c and 980 damage (49%25) would hit each stack of Fighters and Corvettes.%0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c %0a%3c The change has been made now, that instead of 1%25, 5%25 of damage is sent%0a%3c at each of the unit stacks that fighters could not otherwise damage.%0a%3c This reduces the effect of fighter drops because you'll need more%0a%3c fighters to destroy the same amount of unshielded ships as you%0a%3c previously needed.%0a%3c %0a%3c As a result, I am recommending the building of heavy shielded ships,%0a%3c like Heavy Cruisers and Battleships in your defensive screens, even if%0a%3c you have P-Rings. This will reduce the effectiveness of fighter drops%0a%3c significantly, as Heavy Cruisers and Battleships will absorb 5x more of%0a%3c the firepower that would otherwise hit your smaller units under the old%0a%3c system. Whether the system is changed back or not is beyond my guess,%0a%3c but for now, this is how it works. Also, take this into account when%0a%3c attacking large stacks of fleet. Fighter drops will be ineffective%0a%3c against planets with multiple layers of defenses (Ions, Photons,%0a%3c Disruptors, D-shields, P-shields, Rings all absorb 5%25 of attack damage%0a%3c now) and heavy and super capital ships.%0a---%0a> The ideal way to keep a fleet functioning is to keep it in supply.

This makes them ideal as rear echelon units. They are never intended to see combat. The idea is to dispatch your resupply carriers from a jumpgate, drop off their fighter compliment for the FCs in the field to pick up, and then run them back home. In my opinion, Carriers should only be built for resupply purposes, or for when you need to get more fighter transport up fast. Fleet Carriers not only have higher survivability, but they also have more hangar space per credit spent than Carriers do---even if it's not by much. Carriers serve a very specific role once you get FCs, and this is it. Keep plenty of fighters at the jumpgate where the carriers are on standby, and trying to keep enough bombers and heavy bombers on hand to fill your carriers for those instances when your enemy is vulnerable to a bomber or HB drop. Focus on fighters, though.%0a> %0a> Sometimes you won't be able to resupply in time, and you've got the enemy breathing down you neck. You may have taken a strategic point that you're not yet willing to vacate, but you're going to get pounded if you stay because you don't have enough meat left in the fleet. This is the other function of Corvettes. Deploying from a decent jumpgate will almost invariably get Corvettes to your wounded fleet in time for battle unless you've already let the enemy sneak up on you. Corvettes aren't as efficient as meat as fighters are, but their armor-per-credit is equal to bombers. Sometimes Corvettes are the best you can do, but they'll save you thousands in fleet in the long run.%0a> %0a> In the event that you have a large fleet in a relatively secure galaxy but the neighboring galaxies have a smaller guild presence, you may want to build up a cache of fighters at a friendly base in the neighboring galaxy so that you have a resupply point for your fleet if you send reinforcements that way during war. This takes a lot of preparation time, and means you'll have one less campaign fleet to work with. Still, it's well worth it if you think you may have reason to send reinforcements to that galaxy in the future. Half the time, you'll eat through most of your fighter compliment in three or four strikes, leaving your fleet to either make a stand and get crushed for lousy ratios or to head all the way back to your home galaxy to resupply. If you've built up a supply of fighters beforehand, your fleet will have much greater longevity before it is forced to withdraw.%0a> %0a> Okay, that's it for now, folks. I'll get to Volume IV in the near future. Pat yourself on the back if you actually read this hulking monstrosity.

Previously all units would spread out their damage evenly amongst all targets they could do damage too, while only about 1%25 of the damage dealt by a stack would cause damage to each stack of units it could not breech the shields of. Confusing yes, I know. So I give you an example:%0a> %0a> You have 1000 fighters and the enemy has 500 fighters, 300 Corvettes, 4 Heavy Cruisers and a set of Disruptor Turrets. Assuming base technology your fighters would do 2000 points of damage, 20 damage (1%25 of damage) would hit the Disruptors, 20 damage (1%25) would hit the Heavy Cruisers, and 980 damage (49%25) would hit each stack of Fighters and Corvettes.%0a> %0a> The change has been made now, that instead of 1%25, 5%25 of damage is sent at each of the unit stacks that fighters could not otherwise damage. This reduces the effect of fighter drops because you'll need more fighters to destroy the same amount of unshielded ships as you previously needed.%0a> %0a> As a result, I am recommending the building of heavy shielded ships, like Heavy Cruisers and Battleships in your defensive screens, even if you have P-Rings. This will reduce the effectiveness of fighter drops significantly, as Heavy Cruisers and Battleships will absorb 5x more of the firepower that would otherwise hit your smaller units under the old system. Whether the system is changed back or not is beyond my guess, but for now, this is how it works. Also, take this into account when attacking large stacks of fleet. Fighter drops will be ineffective against planets with multiple layers of defenses (Ions, Photons, Disruptors, D-shields, P-shields, Rings all absorb 5%25 of attack damage now) and heavy and super capital ships.%0a> %0a> Good luck and happy hunting,%0a

Balance is good, yes, but that does mean you should be%0a%3c building frigates and including them in your fleets to disperse the%0a%3c damage. Let's take a look at all of your units and their applications.%0a%3c While some units are better than others, most have something they do%0a%3c well.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c :Fighters: These are the staple of all fleets in AE---defense, offense, everything. Fighters are the single most efficient ship in the game. The damage they absorb per credit is unparalleled. That makes fighters your #1 unit for use as cannon fodder. When we say you can never have too many fighters, we're being quite literal. A fleet that runs out of fighters will take far higher losses, and can be defeated in detail for obscene exchange rates by anyone who manages to catch them. Build thousands for base defense, and then keep building them for use with offensive fleets. You go through fighters at an obscene rate because fighters are basically designed to die. Application of fighter waves in combat can totally change your exchange rate for the better.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Bombers: Same armor as fighters with twice the firepower and twice the cost. These are less efficient, but still make for pretty efficient meat. Their ability to harm cruisers makes them especially handy. Don't go overboard with Bombers, but they make a good addition to any fleet that needs to absorb a lot of damage, or one that's hitting a large group of cruisers. Since most people use a lot of cruisers, bombers can be very useful.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Heavy Bombers (HBs): Heavy Bombers pack enough punch to take out main fleet units---Cruisers and Heavy Cruisers---but they're vulnerable and expensive, as well. Heavy Bombers are best used in waves after you have used fighter waves to destroy the enemy's unshielded units. Heavy Bombers are inefficient against unshielded units, and therefore should not be used in main fleet engagements. Enemy fighters will cut them to ribbons. HBs are also the best ships for breaking occupations if you have a proper amount of Command Centers.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Ion Bombers (IBs): Double the price of Heavy Bombers, with the same power and armor. All they gain is one point of shielding, which does practically nothing for their survivability, and their weapons become Ion based, so 50%25 penetrates shielding. Oh, yay. These things suck. They're so expensive that they're not even efficient in waves. If you send a wave of Ion Bombers against capital ships of equal value---be they cruisers, HCs, or BBs---it's impossible for the Ion Bombers to come out ahead in the exchange. The first ship class they can attack efficiently is Dreadnoughts, and that's only barely. Bigger ships are vastly more efficient, so don't waste your money on these.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Corvettes: Corvettes are extremely handy because they're extremely fast. I don't include Corvettes in battle fleets, personally. They can be used as meat with the same efficiency as bombers, but they're too useful in their other applications to waste them as meat when you don't have to. I keep Corvette fleets of 500 or so at jumpgates for recycler hunting and/or reinforcement of damaged fleets that are almost out of fighters. They're fast enough to make excellent raiders, and that speed also makes them great to use as emergency meat. Fighters are twice as efficient, but if you don't have enough and you've got a fleet that's about to get hit, get your Corvettes there instead.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Recyclers (RCs): These are not combat units, but that doesn't mean you don't need them. You need a ton. Resource denial is key to waging war. You should probably have at least 1000 for effective hit-and-run tactics. This will be covered in another volume.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Destroyers (DDs, tin cans): This is your first Plasma unit. Since the bulk of your fleet should be Plasma units, your Plasma research should be high, making Destroyers even more handy. They can be used as a combination attack/meat ship in attack fleets, but their low survivability makes them poor units to include in fleets that will spend much time in enemy territory. A few fighter waves can wipe them out very efficiently if you're caught while you're not online. Destroyers are the best ship for efficiently killing Cruisers, but the fact that Destroyers are unshielded means they're vulnerable to meat ships. If you find some naked Cruisers, wipe them out with Destroyers. I like to keep a fairly large Destroyer unit on standby at my jumpgates to facilitate rapid reinforcement of my bases if I see an enemy fleet coming. Destroyers pack a punch sufficient to damage Cruisers and HCs, which are primary fleet units. When you have Command Centers behind them, they play hell with enemy ratios, therefore creating larger debris piles over your planets. Handy! They're also fast enough for some Recycler hunting.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Frigates: These ships are handy for one thing: telling whether or not a player is an idiot mouthbreather. If he's got a lot of Frigates, chances are you're dealing with a noob. ATTENTION: FRIGATES SUCK. DON'T BUILD THEM. EVER.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Ion Frigates: Just like Frigates, only with Ion weapons and one point of shielding to go with a price tag 50%25 higher than it's counterpart. Think that makes them better? Not really.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Carriers: All those fighters don't do much good without a way to get them around. That's what these are for. They have less survivability than Fleet Carriers, but they're also faster. I keep a group at my jumpgates for rapid reinforcement. ALWAYS RETREAT YOUR CARRIERS BEFORE ATTACKING. If I see you attacking with Carriers, I'm going to hit you in the brainpan with a salmon. You have been warned.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Cruisers: This is the most efficient capital ship in the game. Build lots and lots of them. At least 35%25 of my total fleet strength is Cruisers. (Fighters are another 35%25 or so.) Cruisers are the most efficient ship for taking out anything up to Dreadnoughts (although Heavy Cruisers are more efficient against Dreadnoughts if they have fighters accompanying them). Cruisers are also the most efficient way to take out Planetary Rings, but it takes a whole lot of them. Make sure you have enough. Cruisers should be the backbone of your main battle fleets.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Heavy Cruisers (HCs): The only thing HCs can't hurt is a Death Star. HCs are handy against the big stuff, but I don't use them in main fleet formations unless I'm attacking something with BBs or higher. HCs are fairly efficient, but Cruisers will get you better ratios. HCs are great for taking out BBs and above, and as a bonus, they have enough shielding to be effectively immune to fighters, unless they have CCs behind them. HCs can be included in main battle fleets if you don't mind taking something of a ratio hit.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Battleships (BBs): The sad fact of AE is that the bigger the ships get, the less efficient they get. Every ship is vulnerable to smaller ships. That holds true for Battleships as well. The efficiency drop from HCs to BBs is huge. Most people have far too many. Still, Battleships have their uses. For taking out Levis and Death Stars, this is the most efficient ship. Battleships are also immune to fighters, making them a good ship for taking out weakly defended planets or for holding an occupation. Battleships are poor ships to include in most battle fleets due to their terrible inefficiency against Cruisers/HCs (which is what most enemy fleets are built around).%0a%3c %0a%3c :Fleet Carriers (FCs): FCs sacrifice speed for survivability. They have strong enough shields to shield-rape small units. If you have a calculator and you are very careful, it's possible to include FCs in attacks to improve ratios. This is dangerous, though. Don't do it if you're not experienced. You should have lots of FCs to move all your fighters around.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Dreadnoughts (DNs): The bigger you get, the less efficient you get. The big stuff is best used against things that can't hurt it. The strength of these units is their shields. They're great for taking out bases that have defenses weaker than Disruptors, so long as there aren't fleet units big enough to have a chance at taking you down. Dreadnoughts can make a fair addition to a combat fleet if A) you're fighting things that won't be able to kill one, given the dispersion of damage amongst your units and B) you're prepared to slow your entire fleet down in order to include them. If you might lose one, you're better off leaving it out. If you can safely add one without losing it, feel free; it'll soak some damage away from your other units.%0a%3c %0a%3c :Titans: This is the first unit with high enough shields to shield-rape Cruisers. That makes them very handy. On the downside, these things are slower than zombies playing Monopoly. Seriously, slooooooooooooow. HCs will kill them efficiently if you hit them with enough. BBs will kill them less efficiently, but require less bulk. Something like 130 HCs will kill a Titan, tech dependent, but it only takes about 20 BBs. The HCs should get about a 2:1 ratio, while the BBs will get less than 1.5:1. Titans are great to send out solo to smash bases with less than rings.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> Before you start pillaging and burning you must learn somethings about your weapons and its usage.%0a> %0a> %0a> Not all ships are made equal!%0a> %0a> One of the problems with balanced fleet doctrine is that it tends to make people think they need to use ships that they have no need for in a fleet, giving their enemies an opportunity to destroy them more efficiently.

By using only your most efficient units, you come out well ahead in the exchange.%0a> %0a159,160c140%0a%3c --------------%0a%3c %0a---%0a> %0a170a151,153%0a> %0a> %0a> %0a176,177c159%0a%3c ==================%0a%3c %0a---%0a> %0a180,181c162,163%0a%3c Well, it's an idea.

Fleet Carriers are essential in combat fleets, with their high survivability saving you tons of credits if you get caught flat-footed. They make poor resupply vessels, though, because they're not as fast. Regular carriers are far easier to kill, but are also 33%25 faster than Fleet Carriers. This makes them ideal as rear echelon units. They are never intended to see combat. The idea is to dispatch your resupply carriers from a jumpgate, drop off their fighter compliment for the FCs in the field to pick up, and then run them back home. In my opinion, Carriers should only be built for resupply purposes, or for when you need to get more fighter transport up fast. Fleet Carriers not only have higher survivability, but they also have more hangar space per credit spent than Carriers do---even if it's not by much. Carriers serve a very specific role once you get FCs, and this is it. Keep plenty of fighters at the jumpgate where the carriers are on standby, and trying to keep enough bombers and heavy bombers on hand to fill your carriers for those instances when your enemy is vulnerable to a bomber or HB drop.

diff:1189516175:1189516175:=1,233d0%0a%3c There are few things that test you manhood like facing down an enemy on the field of battle. It takes rigorous training and discipline to become an honored warrior on the field. Work hard enough and you will find people know your name, and it has become synonymous with dignity, honor, and fair play.%0a%3c %0a%3c Yeah, if you're looking for that shinizle, you're totally in the wrong place. I'm going to teach you to sneak up on your opponent in the dark, suckerpunch him, and gut him from crotch to sternum so you can play with his glistening entrails. Fingerpainting with your enemy's viscera while laughing hysterically is much more intimidating. Just ask the British how well fair play worked for them in the American Revolutionary War.%0a%3c %0a%3c Before you start pillaging and burning you must learn somethings about your weapons and its usage.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Not all ships are made equal!%0a%3c %0a%3c One of the problems with balanced fleet doctrine is that it tends to make people think they need to use ships that they have no need for in a fleet, giving their enemies an opportunity to destroy them more efficiently. Balance is good, yes, but that does mean you should be building frigates and including them in your fleets to disperse the damage. Let's take a look at all of your units and their applications. While some units are better than others, most have something they do well.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Fighters: These are the staple of all fleets in AE-- defense, offense, everything. Fighters are the single most efficient ship in the game. The damage they absorb per credit is unparalleled. That makes fighters your #1 unit for use as cannon fodder. When we say you can never have too many fighters, we're being quite literal. A fleet that runs out of fighters will take far higher losses, and can be defeated in detail for obscene exchange rates by anyone who manages to catch them. Build thousands for base defense, and then keep building them for use with offensive fleets. You go through fighters at an obscene rate because fighters are basically designed to die. Application of fighter waves in combat can totally change your exchange rate for the better.%0a%3c %0a%3c Bombers: Same armor as fighters with twice the firepower and twice the cost. These are less efficient, but still make for pretty efficient meat. Their ability to harm cruisers makes them especially handy. Don't go overboard with Bombers, but they make a good addition to any fleet that needs to absorb a lot of damage, or one that's hitting a large group of cruisers. Since most people use a lot of cruisers, bombers can be very useful.%0a%3c %0a%3c Heavy Bombers (HBs): Heavy Bombers pack enough punch to take out main fleet units-- Cruisers and Heavy Cruisers-- but they're vulnerable and expensive, as well. Heavy Bombers are best used in waves after you have used fighter waves to destroy the enemy's unshielded units. Heavy Bombers are inefficient against unshielded units, and therefore should not be used in main fleet engagements. Enemy fighters will cut them to ribbons. HBs are also the best ships for breaking occupations if you have a proper amount of Command Centers.%0a%3c %0a%3c Ion Bombers (IBs): Double the price of Heavy Bombers, with the same power and armor. All they gain is one point of shielding, which does practically nothing for their survivability, and their weapons become Ion based, so 50%25 penetrates shielding. Oh, yay. These things suck. They're so expensive that they're not even efficient in waves. If you send a wave of Ion Bombers against capital ships of equal value-- be they cruisers, HCs, or BBs-- it's impossible for the Ion Bombers to come out ahead in the exchange. The first ship class they can attack efficiently is Dreadnoughts, and that's only barely. Bigger ships are vastly more efficient, so don't waste your money on these.%0a%3c %0a%3c Corvettes: Corvettes are extremely handy because they're extremely fast. I don't include Corvettes in battle fleets, personally. They can be used as meat with the same efficiency as bombers, but they're too useful in their other applications to waste them as meat when you don't have to. I keep Corvette fleets of 500 or so at jumpgates for recycler hunting and/or reinforcement of damaged fleets that are almost out of fighters. They're fast enough to make excellent raiders, and that speed also makes them great to use as emergency meat. Fighters are twice as efficient, but if you don't have enough and you've got a fleet that's about to get hit, get your Corvettes there instead.%0a%3c %0a%3c Recyclers (RCs): These are not combat units, but that doesn't mean you don't need them. You need a ton. Resource denial is key to waging war. You should probably have at least 1000 for effective hit-and-run tactics. This will be covered in another volume.%0a%3c %0a%3c Destroyers (DDs, tin cans): This is your first Plasma unit. Since the bulk of your fleet should be Plasma units, your Plasma research should be high, making Destroyers even more handy. They can be used as a combination attack/meat ship in attack fleets, but their low survivability makes them poor units to include in fleets that will spend much time in enemy territory. A few fighter waves can wipe them out very efficiently if you're caught while you're not online. Destroyers are the best ship for efficiently killing Cruisers, but the fact that Destroyers are unshielded means they're vulnerable to meat ships. If you find some naked Cruisers, wipe them out with Destroyers. I like to keep a fairly large Destroyer unit on standby at my jumpgates to facilitate rapid reinforcement of my bases if I see an enemy fleet coming. Destroyers pack a punch sufficient to damage Cruisers and HCs, which are primary fleet units. When you have Command Centers behind them, they play hell with enemy ratios, therefore creating larger debris piles over your planets. Handy! They're also fast enough for some Recycler hunting.%0a%3c %0a%3c Frigates: These ships are handy for one thing: telling whether or not a player is an idiot mouthbreather. If he's got a lot of Frigates, chances are you're dealing with a noob. ATTENTION: FRIGATES SUCK. DON'T BUILD THEM. EVER.%0a%3c %0a%3c Ion Frigates: Just like Frigates, only with Ion weapons and one point of shielding to go with a price tag 50%25 higher than it's counterpart. Think that makes them better? Not really.%0a%3c %0a%3c Carriers: All those fighters don't do much good without a way to get them around. That's what these are for. They have less survivability than Fleet Carriers, but they're also faster. I keep a group at my jumpgates for rapid reinforcement. ALWAYS RETREAT YOUR CARRIERS BEFORE ATTACKING. If I see you attacking with Carriers, I'm going to hit you in the brainpan with a salmon. You have been warned.%0a%3c %0a%3c Cruisers: This is the most efficient capital ship in the game. Build lots and lots of them. At least 35%25 of my total fleet strength is Cruisers. (Fighters are another 35%25 or so.) Cruisers are the most efficient ship for taking out anything up to Dreadnoughts (although Heavy Cruisers are more efficient against Dreadnoughts if they have fighters accompanying them). Cruisers are also the most efficient way to take out Planetary Rings, but it takes a whole lot of them. Make sure you have enough. Cruisers should be the backbone of your main battle fleets.%0a%3c %0a%3c Heavy Cruisers (HCs): The only thing HCs can't hurt is a Death Star. HCs are handy against the big stuff, but I don't use them in main fleet formations unless I'm attacking something with BBs or higher. HCs are fairly efficient, but Cruisers will get you better ratios. HCs are great for taking out BBs and above, and as a bonus, they have enough shielding to be effectively immune to fighters, unless they have CCs behind them. HCs can be included in main battle fleets if you don't mind taking something of a ratio hit.%0a%3c %0a%3c Battleships (BBs): The sad fact of AE is that the bigger the ships get, the less efficient they get. Every ship is vulnerable to smaller ships. That holds true for Battleships as well. The efficiency drop from HCs to BBs is huge. Most people have far too many. Still, Battleships have their uses. For taking out Levis and Death Stars, this is the most efficient ship. Battleships are also immune to fighters, making them a good ship for taking out weakly defended planets or for holding an occupation. Battleships are poor ships to include in most battle fleets due to their terrible inefficiency against Cruisers/HCs (which is what most enemy fleets are built around).%0a%3c %0a%3c Fleet Carriers (FCs): FCs sacrifice speed for survivability. They have strong enough shields to shield-rape small units. If you have a calculator and you are very careful, it's possible to include FCs in attacks to improve ratios. This is dangerous, though. Don't do it if you're not experienced. You should have lots of FCs to move all your fighters around.%0a%3c %0a%3c Dreadnoughts (DNs): The bigger you get, the less efficient you get. The big stuff is best used against things that can't hurt it. The strength of these units is their shields. They're great for taking out bases that have defenses weaker than Disruptors, so long as there aren't fleet units big enough to have a chance at taking you down. Dreadnoughts can make a fair addition to a combat fleet if A) you're fighting things that won't be able to kill one, given the dispersion of damage amongst your units and B) you're prepared to slow your entire fleet down in order to include them. If you might lose one, you're better off leaving it out. If you can safely add one without losing it, feel free; it'll soak some damage away from your other units.%0a%3c %0a%3c Titans: This is the first unit with high enough shields to shield-rape Cruisers. That makes them very handy. On the downside, these things are slower than zombies playing Monopoly. Seriously, slooooooooooooow. HCs will kill them efficiently if you hit them with enough. BBs will kill them less efficiently, but require less bulk. Something like 130 HCs will kill a Titan, tech dependent, but it only takes about 20 BBs. The HCs should get about a 2:1 ratio, while the BBs will get less than 1.5:1. Titans are great to send out solo to smash bases with less than rings.%0a%3c %0a%3c I'm not even going to cover bigger things, because if you have them, you've been around more than long enough to know what to do with them, I would hope.%0a%3c %0a%3c Here are the most important parts for review:%0a%3c %0a%3c Fighters and Cruisers should be the bulk of your fleet.%0a%3c Keep enough HCs around to deal with the big stuff, with more than that if you want to use them in main fleets.%0a%3c Don't build Frigates, Ion Frigates, or Ion Bombers unless you're sustained serious head injuries and you tend to drool a lot.%0a%3c Bigger isn't always better. The bigger you get, the less efficient you get. Don't build too much of the big stuff.%0a%3c %0a%3c This concludes volume one, kiddies! Now that you know what ships are good for what, you should have some idea of what to build.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PART 2%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Now that you have a decent grasp on the roles of your combat units, it's time to see how these varying roles affects your fleet composition. There are three main types of combat doctrine you will so your opponents using: balanced fleet doctrine, efficiency doctrine, and what I call e-p*n*s doctrine. That's how I think of them, anyway. In the case of e-p*n*s doctrine, it's not really a doctrine at all; it's a fallacious belief that bigger is better. A lot of people are entirely too top-heavy, and since the most expensive ships are generally the least efficient, you get huge kill ratios from them.%0a%3c %0a%3c Efficiency doctrine is basically just balanced doctrine evolved. Under balanced doctrine, you should have equal armor values of different units. That's all well and good, but against a thinking opponent, your fleets can be dismantled easily. The problem with balanced doctrine is that it frequently leads people to build less efficient ship types to mix into their fleets to soak damage from other types of ships. Against someone fighting efficiently, you're going to get owned.%0a%3c %0a%3c Dismantling a Balanced Fleet%0a%3c %0a%3c Let's take the example from the Art of War post. Your balanced fleet looks like this:%0a%3c %0a%3c 1 Dreadnought = 512 Armor%0a%3c 4 Battleships = 512 Armor%0a%3c 16 Heavy Cruisers = 768 Armor%0a%3c 32 Cruisers = 768 Armor%0a%3c 96 Destroyers = 768 Armor%0a%3c 192 Corvettes = 768 Armor%0a%3c 192 Heavy Bomber's = 768 Armor%0a%3c 384 Bomber's = 768 Armor%0a%3c 384 Fighter's = 768 Armor%0a%3c %0a%3c The total credit value of this fleet is 51,600 credits. (I'm leaving out the Fleet Carriers since they're not intended as combat units if it can be avoided.) Now, let's see how this balanced fleet fares against an equal-value fleet of Fighters and Cruisers (transports not included) with some basic fighter wave tactics.%0a%3c Let's say this is the other fleet:%0a%3c %0a%3c 3120 Fighters%0a%3c 180 Cruisers%0a%3c %0a%3c That's it. No frills. We'll assume equal tech levels for both fleets. These two fleets aren't going to clash directly, though. The attacking fleet of Cruisers/Fighters will first perform a fighter drop to take out the unshielded units.%0a%3c %0a%3c 2300 Fighters%0a%3c %0a%3c vs.%0a%3c %0a%3c 1 Dreadnought%0a%3c 4 Battleships%0a%3c 16 Heavy Cruisers%0a%3c 32 Cruisers%0a%3c 96 Destroyers%0a%3c 192 Corvettes%0a%3c 192 Heavy Bomber's%0a%3c 384 Bomber's%0a%3c 384 Fighter's%0a%3c %0a%3c After the fighter wave, the balanced fleet is left with this:%0a%3c %0a%3c 1 Dreadnought%0a%3c 4 Battleships%0a%3c 16 Heavy Cruisers%0a%3c 32 Cruisers%0a%3c %0a%3c Whoops! Not so balanced anymore. Bring in the Cruisers, and the formerly balanced fleet gets cut to ribbons.%0a%3c %0a%3c 820 Fighters%0a%3c 180 Cruisers%0a%3c %0a%3c vs.%0a%3c %0a%3c 1 Dreadnought%0a%3c 4 Battleships%0a%3c 16 Heavy Cruisers%0a%3c 32 Cruisers%0a%3c %0a%3c =%0a%3c %0a%3c 252 Fighters%0a%3c 137 Cruisers%0a%3c %0a%3c vs.%0a%3c %0a%3c 0.1 Battleship%0a%3c 0.69 Dreadnought%0a%3c %0a%3c One more attack, and the assault force is left with 155 Fighters and 129 Cruisers. Total losses: 25025. Enemy losses: 51600. Voila! 2:1 ratio.%0a%3c %0a%3c This is the problem with balanced doctrine. If you use a lot of different unit types, it does in fact disperse the damage across them. The problem is, any unshielded unit is vulnerable to fighters, which are the most efficient unit in the game. Use a battle calculator to find how many fighters you need to attack with in one wave to destroy all the unshielded units. Drop that many and no more; overkill just wastes fighters and ruins your ratios as the enemy's shielded units kill the extra fighters with practically no losses. Once the enemy's unshielded units are gone, you send in the Cruisers-- which are the most efficient ship to kill the shielded units-- with the remaining fighters as a meatshield. By using only your most efficient units, you come out well ahead in the exchange.%0a%3c %0a%3c The spirit of balanced doctrine, though, is that you should have enough meat to protect your larger ships. This is an important concept. If you attacked with 200 Cruisers and 20 Fighters after the enemy had lost their unshielded units, you would finish the same fight with nothing but 121 Cruisers, for 27400 in losses and a slightly weaker ratio. No matter what your fleet composition is, you should always make sure you have enough of your most efficient ships to soak damage from the less efficient.%0a%3c %0a%3c This goes back to the idea that you can never have too many fighters. If you're running a battle calculator and you come out of a fight with 0 fighters, you don't have enough. You should always end up with some fighters remaining because if you run out, the damage they would have absorbed is being transferred to your more expensive ships.%0a%3c %0a%3c Efficiency FTW%0a%3c %0a%3c With Fighters being the most efficient unshielded unit and Cruisers being the most efficient shielded unit, the two together make the most well-rounded combat fleet in the game. If you have good balance between cruisers and fighters, your fleet has no significant weakness. Fighter waves meet with a negative exchange ratio. Attacking with Destroyers gets about a 2:1 ratio against naked Cruisers, but the Fighters get about 2.5:1 against Destroyers, so the two together cover one another's weaknesses.%0a%3c %0a%3c If faced with a fleet of Cruisers and Fighters, you've got to take poor ratios to get rid of the fighters before you can get good ratios on the Cruisers, unless you've got a Levi or something to shield-rape the Cruisers into submission. The best you can do is eat the bad ratios against the fighters be dropping in a wave of your own fighters and then follow up with Destroyers for a 2:1 ratio if you're capable. You're usually not able to manage that, so you may as well just run into them with your own Cruiser/Fighter unit for even odds and let the debris compensate for your lack of winning ratio.%0a%3c %0a%3c In order to put together efficient fleets, you need to know your target. Cruisers and Fighters are usually the most efficient fleet. Bear in mind, you should have Carriers/Fleet Carriers to ferry around fighters; while Cruisers can carry four fighters each, that's not nearly enough for long-term operations. Fighters are disposable, so keep plenty in supply. Heavy Cruisers are more efficient against everything up to Titans and Leviathans, and close to equal with Cruisers in efficiency against Dreadnoughts. Unshielded units are always vulnerable to fighter waves, so leaving these as part of a combat fleet in enemy territory is asking for poor ratios. (They have their place, certainly; we covered that in Volume I.) Using unshielded units in an assault can be fine, don't get me wrong; in the event that you're using a large-scale fleet with many unit types, a la balanced doctrine, having extra ship types to balance the damage out can save your ratios. Most of the time, though, you should have that many unit types in your fleets because it forces you to use less efficient means of soaking damage.%0a%3c %0a%3c Efficiency doctrine is just about taking balanced doctrine and distilling it down to its core. Balanced doctrine seeks to achieve efficiency by using cheaper units to protect the larger units. Efficiency doctrine eliminates the less efficient units from the fleet entirely, distilling attack fleets down to their most efficient elements. That doesn't mean you should build nothing but Fighters and Cruisers, but it does mean they should make up a very large portion of your fleet. Make sure you have a strong Heavy Cruiser contingent for the big stuff. Keeping a few BBs and DNs around can be handy, but don't go overboard with the large units.%0a%3c %0a%3c That's all for now, people. By now you should be on your way to becoming a force to be reckoned with. Keep your eyes peeled for more.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c You have some idea how to put fleets together, so let's cover how to use them.%0a%3c %0a%3c I live by a simple motto: "That which does not kill me has made a grave tactical error." If the enemy is not putting you under pressure, he's letting you take initiative and dictate the pace and the stakes of the conflict. Accept that offer.%0a%3c %0a%3c Strategic Thinking%0a%3c %0a%3c Every now and then, a guild in AstroEmpires gets the genius idea to turtle simultaneously during a major war. The idea may look good on the surface: base defenses and Command Centers vastly increase exchange rates, so why not keep your fleet above your planets where they can reap the benefits? Surely you can break the enemy's back this way!%0a%3c %0a%3c Well, it's an idea. Granted, it's one that goes against thousands of years of military strategy. It may look good on paper, but the fact is initiative is too valuable an asset in war. If you sit back and wait for your enemy to come to you, he will. And he'll do it with overwhelming force. You'll get good exchange rates, and then your enemy will scoop all the debris and turn it into fleet to replace his losses. Meanwhile, all your fleet was at home where it just got smashed, so you have no hope of liberating your bases. Because your enemy was under no pressure, he could amass a force to come after you at his leisure. It's the same reason hackers are always one step ahead of security: It's impossible to create an impregnable defense. If you have a determined enemy who knows what he's dealing with-- all he has to do is sit a scout somewhere in the region to watch you-- then he can figure out exactly what he needs to break your defenses. Given time, he'll put together a fleet to break you, and he doesn't have to worry about uncovering one of his systems to do it because he's not under any pressure.%0a%3c %0a%3c A winning strategy is one that takes the initiative. Aggression forces your opponent to worry about protecting his own assets. Half the reason I'm riding people about defenses is so they will have bases that their enemies are afraid to attack. Some people would rather look for another target than attack a base with two sets of disruptors and deflectors. Once you get p-rings and p-shields, people really hate messing with you. If your enemy is weak or timid, he'll stall forever before attacking you, waiting to get more fleet online to make sure they have overwhelming odds. Hit one of his bases during this span, and he may never hit you back if you're well defended. If you just stepped up and hit him in the mouth, he'll be too worried about leaving himself open to another attack to go on the offensive. You've got him thinking about how you hurt him, not about how he can hurt you.%0a%3c %0a%3c Conditioning Your Enemy%0a%3c %0a%3c Remember how I said fingerpainting with your enemy's viscera while laughing hysterical is more intimidating than being know as an honorable warrior? Well, we're in the strategy section now, so let's start getting into that. When a war first kicks off, I like to employ a tactic that I call Pavlov's Rapetrain. The first enemy aggression will almost invariably occur against the weakest friendly bases in the area. These are simply attacks of opportunity. Soft targets provide an easy economy boost for the enemy. Everyone does it.%0a%3c %0a%3c Still, attacking a soft target shows initiative, and that's something we don't want to see out of our opponents. On top of that, it may sometimes bely an unwillingness to attack except from a position of extreme superiority. I say sometimes, because that's not necessarily the case; I hit soft targets early, too, when I know where they are. It's good business; it boosts your economy, you can get in and out quickly because there won't be much debris to scoop, and it immediately lets your opponent know you're willing to dance. The enemy is sending a message. Pavlov's Rapetrain is about replying to that message.%0a%3c %0a%3c It's fairly simple: First one to show aggression rides the rapetrain. It doesn't matter how well-defended he is. It doesn't matter if there are softer targets around. The soft targets don't pose a threat. Not only have they shown no aggression, but they're also easy meat for whenever you get around to them. Focus on the enemy aggressors, and knock them back on their heels. Pick one of their production bases-- as a bonus, these are frequently jumpgate worlds, and often house a large fleet if it's not out on assault duty-- and smash it. These are usually well defended worlds, and you will take significant losses in order to break them. If you don't have enough fleet to take it without being crippled, coordinate with guildmates. Don't break yourself to send a message, but if you don't have enough fleet to take one base without breaking yourself, you really aren't ready for war yet to begin with.%0a%3c %0a%3c This is all about sending a message back to him. You want to show him that no matter how well defended he is, he always has to worry about you hitting him. Don't let him feel safe simply because he has p-rings up. Roll in with a thousand cruisers and show him how little you worry about his rings. You want him to worry about sending his fleet to the front because he may need it back home.%0a%3c %0a%3c Now, while preparing for the attack, coordinate with any guildmates in your area to locate and destroy each of his bases. If he hits one soft target and suddenly finds himself ass deep in debris that the enemy is feeding on, commanding an empire of ruined planets, chances are he's going to be less aggressive in the future. You want to teach him that aggression is dangerous, and force him into a timid, defensive mindset. You're also taking the first aggressors of the war and making an example of them. I employed this tactic in the Beta War, and the aggressor that I hit never assaulted one of our planets in that galaxy again. Only one member of his guild ever attacked one of our planets in that galaxy after those attacks. You want his guild to see the price he pays for aggression. The psychological effect you have on your opponents may be enough to take the initiative from them permanently.%0a%3c %0a%3c The easy targets are probably still going to be easy targets later. Teach the more active and aggressive players what happens when they attack. If you can get them to fallaciously think they weren't defending their planets well enough, they'll keep more of their fleet at home where you don't have to worry about it.%0a%3c %0a%3c Tempo and Resource Denial%0a%3c %0a%3c There's more to war in AstroEmpires than just destroying the other guy's fleet and getting good ratios. You can get 3:1 ratios all day long and still let your enemy come out ahead if you neglect the debris. ATTACKING AN ENEMY, SMASHING THEIR FLEET, AND THEN MOVING ON AND LEAVING THE DEBRIS BEHIND IS NOT A VICTORY. This is a very important concept. It may look like you just won, but if you let him have the debris, you haven't really done anything because all that debris is going to be converted back into fleet. Fleet replacement is absolutely essential in a protracted engagement; it's very possible for your fleet numbers to actually go up during a war if you're getting maintaining good ratios and getting most of the debris.%0a%3c %0a%3c Because of this dynamic, the pace of your offensive is limited by your ability to clean up debris. The more recyclers you have, the faster you can move along. If you've got 1000 cruisers just waiting to tear your enemy apart, you had better not have neglected to build recyclers to follow in their wake. Simply smashing the enemy's fleet and moving along only costs him the time it takes to rebuild; the debris left by the combined losses of the engagement will pay for most of the damage.%0a%3c %0a%3c Caveat: That doesn't mean that raiding tactics are worthless. The economy hit that is dealt to planet when it is occupied is significant, and it takes a long time to fully regenerate. If you don't have the ability to lock down the area and harvest the debris before moving along, but your combat fleet has plenty of fight left in it, employing blitzkrieg tactics and rapidly hitting several of an enemy's bases can deal a massive blow to his economy, even if you're not occupying those bases in the long-term. The problem with this is even if he doesn't have the recyclers available to get the debris himself, he's going to call guildies in to feast, and large amounts of debris may go into the hands of dangerous players.%0a%3c %0a%3c You don't have to get every last scrap of debris you create, but you want to get as much as possible even if you don't need the money. Notice that this section isn't called Resource Harvesting. Resource denial means just that: you're not gathering it because you need it; you're gathering it because your opponent does, and he can't have it if you get it first.%0a%3c %0a%3c To this end, you should have a large recycler fleet. If you have anything less than 1000 recyclers, you shouldn't plan to launch any kind of fast-moving offensive without debris-collecting support form your guildmates. If you have priority targets to hit and you made too big of a mess to clean up and move to the next target quickly, call in your guildies. Don't be selfish with debris; the economic boost is nice, but keeping it away from the enemy is nicer. If you can't empty the debris pile yourself in a reasonable amount of time, call in backup. If you know you're going to be making a large mess in an assault or series of assaults and you won't be able to get much of the debris, notify your guildmates in the area before you launch your offensive so they can get recyclers in a position to start eating debris as soon as possible. If you've got four guildmates in the area and each of you has 1000 recyclers, your combined RC fleets will harvest 50,000 credits worth of debris per hour. Not only that, but it doesn't actually take an hour to process debris; you only have to have your recyclers there for the debris processing update, which comes at half past the hour. With good timing, your vulnerable recyclers may only be available targets for a minute or two, and then a huge chunk of debris is gone.%0a%3c %0a%3c Don't leave your recyclers stationary in enemy territory if you want to keep them. They are priority targets for everyone, and you simply cannot protect them. Since they're unshielded units, fighter attacks or suicide runs from Corvettes can wipe them out no matter how much additional fleet you have there to protect them.%0a%3c %0a%3c Speaking of suiciding Corvettes, you should have a fleet on standby, ready to hunt down enemy recyclers whenever you spot them. I start building more Corvettes any time my number of Corvettes in commission drops below 1000. Corvettes are the fastest attack ship in the game, which makes them ideal for recycler hunting. Don't expect for your Corvettes to survive an especially long time, though; if you find recyclers in the middle of a large fleet, suicide enough Corvettes into the fleet to kill the recyclers. Recyclers are always a priority target. You can take more time scooping debris if you destroy your opponent's ability to claim it.%0a%3c %0a%3c Advanced Logistics%0a%3c %0a%3c Keeping the wheels of war turning requires good logistics. Part of that is simply fleet replacement; while you're running amok and taking your opponent's bases, your production queues should be running full bore back home to keep your force levels the same (or to keep them on the rise). If things are going well and you're getting a lot of money from debris, feel free to use Fast Production. You don't want to be sitting on large stacks of cash if you get pillaged in war.%0a%3c %0a%3c (Note: It's a common but incorrect belief that you lose money when you get pillaged. You don't. But the amount of cash you have on hand is part of the equation that determines how large the enemy pillage is, and you don't want to give him money if he hits you. Let him work for the debris like everyone else. Don't let him get 20k a pop instantly because you're sitting on too much money.)%0a%3c %0a%3c The trickier part of logistics is resupply. The biggest limiting factor on a fleet's utility is its fighter supply. I cannot stress to you the ridiculous number of fighters you will go through in large engagements. I've dropped 6000 fighters just in one wave before. That's not even counting the fighters I used in the main fleet. If you're butting heads with large fleets, you will burn through fighters at a rate that rivals Lindsey Lohan's cocaine consumption. Once you're out of fighters, your fleet is vulnerable and your ratios are screwed. Rapid resupply is essential to continuing fleet function.%0a%3c %0a%3c The ideal way to keep a fleet functioning is to keep it in supply. Fleet Carriers are essential in combat fleets, with their high survivability saving you tons of credits if you get caught flat-footed. They make poor resupply vessels, though, because they're not as fast. Regular carriers are far easier to kill, but are also 33%25 faster than Fleet Carriers. This makes them ideal as rear echelon units. They are never intended to see combat. The idea is to dispatch your resupply carriers from a jumpgate, drop off their fighter compliment for the FCs in the field to pick up, and then run them back home. In my opinion, Carriers should only be built for resupply purposes, or for when you need to get more fighter transport up fast. Fleet Carriers not only have higher survivability, but they also have more hangar space per credit spent than Carriers do-- even if it's not by much. Carriers serve a very specific role once you get FCs, and this is it. Keep plenty of fighters at the jumpgate where the carriers are on standby, and trying to keep enough bombers and heavy bombers on hand to fill your carriers for those instances when your enemy is vulnerable to a bomber or HB drop. Focus on fighters, though.%0a%3c %0a%3c Sometimes you won't be able to resupply in time, and you've got the enemy breathing down you neck. You may have taken a strategic point that you're not yet willing to vacate, but you're going to get pounded if you stay because you don't have enough meat left in the fleet. This is the other function of Corvettes. Deploying from a decent jumpgate will almost invariably get Corvettes to your wounded fleet in time for battle unless you've already let the enemy sneak up on you. Corvettes aren't as efficient as meat as fighters are, but their armor-per-credit is equal to bombers. Sometimes Corvettes are the best you can do, but they'll save you thousands in fleet in the long run.%0a%3c %0a%3c In the event that you have a large fleet in a relatively secure galaxy but the neighboring galaxies have a smaller guild presence, you may want to build up a cache of fighters at a friendly base in the neighboring galaxy so that you have a resupply point for your fleet if you send reinforcements that way during war. This takes a lot of preparation time, and means you'll have one less campaign fleet to work with. Still, it's well worth it if you think you may have reason to send reinforcements to that galaxy in the future. Half the time, you'll eat through most of your fighter compliment in three or four strikes, leaving your fleet to either make a stand and get crushed for lousy ratios or to head all the way back to your home galaxy to resupply. If you've built up a supply of fighters beforehand, your fleet will have much greater longevity before it is forced to withdraw.%0a%3c %0a%3c Okay, that's it for now, folks. I'll get to Volume IV in the near future. Pat yourself on the back if you actually read this hulking monstrosity.

Previously all units would spread out their damage evenly amongst all targets they could do damage too, while only about 1%25 of the damage dealt by a stack would cause damage to each stack of units it could not breech the shields of. Confusing yes, I know. So I give you an example:%0a%3c %0a%3c You have 1000 fighters and the enemy has 500 fighters, 300 Corvettes, 4 Heavy Cruisers and a set of Disruptor Turrets. Assuming base technology your fighters would do 2000 points of damage, 20 damage (1%25 of damage) would hit the Disruptors, 20 damage (1%25) would hit the Heavy Cruisers, and 980 damage (49%25) would hit each stack of Fighters and Corvettes.%0a%3c %0a%3c The change has been made now, that instead of 1%25, 5%25 of damage is sent at each of the unit stacks that fighters could not otherwise damage. This reduces the effect of fighter drops because you'll need more fighters to destroy the same amount of unshielded ships as you previously needed.%0a%3c %0a%3c As a result, I am recommending the building of heavy shielded ships, like Heavy Cruisers and Battleships in your defensive screens, even if you have P-Rings. This will reduce the effectiveness of fighter drops significantly, as Heavy Cruisers and Battleships will absorb 5x more of the firepower that would otherwise hit your smaller units under the old system. Whether the system is changed back or not is beyond my guess, but for now, this is how it works. Also, take this into account when attacking large stacks of fleet. Fighter drops will be ineffective against planets with multiple layers of defenses (Ions, Photons, Disruptors, D-shields, P-shields, Rings all absorb 5%25 of attack damage now) and heavy and super capital ships.%0a%3c %0a%3c Good luck and happy hunting, %0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
