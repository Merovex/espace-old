text=This guide builds off of the [[Advanced Structure Guide]], which%0aprovides basic information on building an efficient empire. This guide%0aoffers the reader a list of structures necessary to attain full%0aefficiency of your specialized astros. Naturally, this will interest%0afree players more. However, all players should find this informative.%0a%0a(:*toc:)%0a%0aThis guide will approach the problem of efficient base structures from a%0apessimistic perspective. That is, the least preferred astro type will be%0aused. %0aBecause this guide focuses on free play, Planets will be preferred.%0aAdvanced structures will also be capped at five.%0aSlot 2 orbit will be assumed to help illustrate the advice given in the%0a[[Advanced Base Guide]]. %0aThe first section discusses how to efficiently build a%0aCommerce Asteroid. The second section discusses how to build a Research%0abase. The final section discusses how to build a Production base.%0a%0aGeneral Information%0a===================%0a%0aOne question you may be asking yourself is why the different types of%0abases need a certain configuration---and why that configuration is%0adifferent. There are two general categories of structures---Production%0aand Infrastructure---common to all bases. Production structures include%0aMetal Refineries, Robotic Factories, Nanite Factories and Androids%0aFactories. Infrastructure includes Urban Structures, various power%0aPlants, Command Centers and Spaceports. Technically, Terraforming is not%0aa structure.%0a%0aIf you look at the cost list of each type of Production structure,%0ayou'll note that Metal Refineries-17 costs about the same as Nanite%0aFactories-9 (actually, the cost is within 100 credits).%0a%0aValue of Structures%0a===================%0a%0aOrbital Structures%0a~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%0a%0aOrbital Structures give free players a maximum of fifty population, and%0athis is not influenced by Biosphere Modification. The table below shows%0athe number of slots freed by removing Urban Strcutures based on%0aFertility. %0a%0a||! Fertility ||! Savings ||%0a|| 7 || 7 ||%0a|| 6 || 8 ||%0a|| 5 || 10 ||%0a|| 4 || 12 ||%0a%0aAntimatter Plants%0a~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%0a%0aAntimatter Plants generates a maximum of 100 energy, allowing free%0aplayers to disband 12 Fusion Plants while still providing four extra%0aenergy units. The actual slot savings is five.%0a%0a%0aCommerce Asteroid%0a=================%0a%0aThe Commerce Asteroid is considered the pessimistic choice. This is%0abecause you are limited in the number of structures you can build. You%0aare also limited in the amount of Crystals you can harvest. We will%0aassume Energy-20, which doubles output of your energy Plants.%0a%0aWhen considering the value of an Asteroid, you should look at the%0aadvanced strucutures.  Antimatter Plants combined with Orbital%0aStructures frees 15 slots on a Slot-2 Asteroid. Normally, a fully%0aterraformed Asteroid spends 23 slots for Urban Structures and Plants.%0aSo, these advanced structures reclaim eight slots. For an Asteroid,%0athose slots would preferably be spent building ten more Shipyards (and%0adisband two Metal Refineries for the space). This gives 20 more economy.%0a%0a%0a|| class=structure cellspacing=0%0a|| &nbsp;                  || Terraformed || Anti ||%0a|| '''Urban Structures'''  || 14   ||  8   ||%0a|| '''Orbital Base'''      || -    ||  5   ||%0a|| '''Fusion Plants'''     || 9    ||  -   ||%0a|| '''Antimatter Plants''' || -    ||  5   ||%0a|| '''Metal Refineries'''  || 16%0a|| '''Nanite Factories'''  || 5    || 5  -10 %0a|| '''Android Factories''' || -    || 5  -20 %0a|| '''Spaceports'''        || 10   || 15  -15%0a|| '''Command Centers'''   || 10   || 10  -10 (-55)%0a|| '''Shipyards'''         || 10   || 12  -12 (-67)%0a|| '''Crystal Mines'''     || 5    || 13  -%0a|| '''Total'''             || 84   ||   %0a%0a%0aTundra Research%0a===============%0a%0aMetallic Production%0a===================%0a%0a(:comment This page has been edited using Pywe:)
