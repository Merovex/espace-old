text=You start with a base, your first planet and you don't know what to build to make an empire. I will try to help with this guide some basic informations to develop your empire.%0a%0aThere are some aspects you must know to define your strategy.%0a%0aFirst - Familiarize with the AstroEmpires page layout, explore the links to get to know where is what, this is somehow important.%0a%0aSecond - Understand every struture, see the table list and give a little atencion to the strutures and the technologies to research to give you more building options. See what is what and what it do.%0a%0a%0aYOUR EMPIRE%0a==========%0a%0aCredits are the monetary unit in the Universe of Astro Empires, and the base of the game's economy. You can use them to build Structures on your Bases, to set up Trade Routes, to produce Spaceships, and to invest on Research.%0a%0aYou receive credits in a per hour basis, based on your Empire's Economy. This can be raised by building structures, establishing trade routes, and conquering other player's bases. You can also get credits by recycling debris in space after battles, plundering trade routes, or pillaging bases after having conquered them.%0aSo the main goal in the Game would be to optimize your resources, and to use them to expand your Empire, through conquests or by establishing new bases, increasing your Credits Income. Diplomacy and Alliances can help you to achieve your objectives.%0a%0a%0a%0aPLANET%0a======%0a%0aEach planet has their level of Solar, Area, Fertility, Metal, Gas and Crystal.%0a%0a:Solar: Is an energy resource that provides energy to the planet%0athe building that produces energy from the Solar Energy of the planet is the Solar Plant,%0aif Solar is level 4, each Solar Plant will give an output of 4.%0a( This also have influences of the Energy Research Tech, that will be discussed later in this guide)%0a%0a:Area: Is the area that the planet has for building structures.%0aEach terrain building will need 1 area, upgrades also needs 1 area.%0aNote that there are orbital strutures wich doesn't requires area on the planet.%0a%0a:Fertility: Is the population level of the planet.%0aEach building will require 1 population, upgrades also needs 1 population.%0aUrban Strutures, Orbital Base and Terraform doesn't requires population.%0a%0aWhen building an Urban Struture it will give more population depending on the planet Fertility level.%0aExample:%0aIf Planet has fertility level 5, each urban struture will give more 5 population.%0a%0a:Metal Resource: A resource that increases Construction and Production processing capacity depending on the planets metal resource level.%0aIf planet has metal resource level 2, each Metal Refinarie will increase 2 cr/h on Constrution and 2 cr/h on Production processing capacity.%0a%0a:Gas Resource: Is an energy resource that provides energy to the planet%0athe building that produces energy from the Gas Resource is the Gas plant,%0aIf Gas is level 2, each Gas Plant will give an output of 2.%0a( This also have influences of the Energy Research Tech, that will be discussed later in this guide)%0a%0a:Crystal Resource: A very profitable resource that increases the planets economy depending on the crystal resource level.%0aIf planet has Crystal resource level of 2, each crystal mine will increase the planets economy 2 cr/h.%0a%0a%0aUnderstand that each planet will have their own levels, ponderate wisely to take the best of the planet.%0a%0aTip:%0a- Try to make each planet you have dedicated, one for Production, one for Research and one for Economy.%0a-Make your first planet an overall of Production, Research and Economy.%0a%0a%0aBASE PROCESSING CAPACITY / BASE OVERVIEW%0a==========================================%0a%0aIn Base Overview you see a box on the right side of the base image.%0a%0a-Constrution: Is the building constrution processing capacity per hour, you start with 6 cr/h, this is how much credits can the base process per hour.

You can use them to build Structures on your Bases, to set up Trade Routes, to produce Spaceships, and to invest on Research.%0a%3c %0a%3c You receive credits in a per hour basis, based on your Empire's Economy. This can be raised by building structures, establishing trade routes, and conquering other player's bases. You can also get credits by recycling debris in space after battles, plundering trade routes, or pillaging bases after having conquered them.%0a%3c So the main goal in the Game would be to optimize your resources, and to use them to expand your Empire, through conquests or by establishing new bases, increasing your Credits Income. Diplomacy and Alliances can help you to achieve your objectives.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLANET%0a%3c ======%0a%3c %0a%3c Each planet has their level of Solar, Area, Fertility, Metal, Gas and Crystal.%0a%3c %0a%3c Solar: Is an energy resource that provides energy to the planet%0a%3c the building that produces energy from the Solar Energy of the planet is the Solar Plant,%0a%3c if Solar is level 4, each Solar Plant will give an output of 4.%0a%3c ( This also have influences of the Energy Research Tech, that will be discussed later in this guide)%0a%3c %0a%3c Area: Is the area that the planet has for building strutures.%0a%3c Each terrain building will need 1 area, upgrades also needs 1 area.%0a%3c Note that there are orbital strutures wich doesn't requires area on the planet.%0a%3c %0a%3c Fertility: Is the population level of the planet.%0a%3c Each building will require 1 population, upgrades also needs 1 population.%0a%3c Urban Strutures, Orbital Base and Terraform doesn't requires population.%0a%3c %0a%3c When building an Urban Struture it will give more population depending on the planet Fertility level.%0a%3c Example:%0a%3c If Planet has fertility level 5, each urban struture will give more 5 population.%0a%3c %0a%3c Metal Resource: A resource that increases Construction and Production processing capacity depending on the planets metal resource level.%0a%3c If planet has metal resource level 2, each Metal Refinarie will increase 2 cr/h on Constrution and 2 cr/h on Production processing capacity.%0a%3c %0a%3c Gas Resource: Is an energy resource that provides energy to the planet%0a%3c the building that produces energy from the Gas Resource is the Gas plant,%0a%3c If Gas is level 2, each Gas Plant will give an output of 2.%0a%3c ( This also have influences of the Energy Research Tech, that will be discussed later in this guide)%0a%3c %0a%3c Crystal Resource: A very profitable resource that increases the planets economy depending on the crystal resource level.%0a%3c If planet has Crystal resource level of 2, each crystal mine will increase the planets economy 2 cr/h.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Understand that each planet will have their own levels, ponderate wisely to take the best of the planet.%0a%3c %0a%3c Tip:%0a%3c - Try to make each planet you have dedicated, one for Production, one for Research and one for Economy.%0a%3c -Make your first planet an overall of Production, Research and Economy.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BASE PROCESSING CAPACITY / BASE OVERVIEW%0a%3c ==========================================%0a%3c %0a%3c In Base Overview you see a box on the right side of the base image.%0a%3c %0a%3c -Constrution: Is the building constrution processing capacity per hour, you start with 6 cr/h, this is how much credits can the base process per hour. For example if a building costs 12 credits it will take 2 hours to that building be done.%0a%3c %0a%3c -Production: Is the Ships Production processing capacity per hour, the processing is the same has for Constrution, but in this case its only for ships, and you need to have Shipyard to produce ship in that base.%0a%3c %0a%3c -Research: Is the Technologies Research processing capacity per hour, the processing is the same has for Constrution, but in this case its only for researchs, and you need to have Research Labs to do researchs in that base.%0a%3c %0a%3c -Economy: This is the Base economy, or your income, the credits you gain per hour from that planet.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BUILDINGS / STRUTURES%0a%3c ========================%0a%3c %0a%3c This is the set of structures that are possible to construct in base, some of them requires energy, others don’t, to se more detailed information about the structures go to this link.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Urban Structures%0a%3c -Each level increases population capacity by Base Fertility.%0a%3c %0a%3c Solar Plants%0a%3c -Each level increases energy by Base Solar.%0a%3c %0a%3c Gas Plants%0a%3c -Each Level increases energy by Base Gas Resource.%0a%3c %0a%3c Fusion Plants%0a%3c -Each level increases energy in 4, (This structure doesn't depends on base energy resources)%0a%3c -Requires Energy Tech Research at level 6 to be available to construction.%0a%3c %0a%3c Antimatters Plants%0a%3c -Each level increases energy in 10.
