text=(:title Last Charge of the Hilkedge Light
Horse:)%0a%3c%3c|ImperiumEditionIndex|>>%0a%0aThe '''Hilkedge Light Horse''' was a society organization comprised mostly of retired military personnel. Its history is steeped in ancient traditions rumored to be rooted in the Ancient British Empire. Through most of its history it was known as a rather sedate place where old myrmadons would relive past glories. Being a society organization, it was also very wealthy. For centuries they would stage mass military demonstrations retelling old tails of past glories. In their heyday, this included the decennial mock space battle recorded and broadcast to several systems. The reinactors were always members of the Light Horse.%0a%0aAt one point, many of the influential members of the Hilkedge Light Horse were retirees of the CathianNavy. This began a long tradition of the Light Horse leadership being Cathian Naval officers. During the negotiations between the CathianNavy and the Imperium, these leaders polarized into two camps: those pro-merger and those opposed.%0a%0aThis polarization climaxed in the TrilisIncident. This event appeared to be an early decennial celebration, but was in fact a staged attack against both pro-Imperium and actual Imperial space vessels. After this event, space-borne celebrations were terminated, and the Light Horse forever after resigned themselves to planet-borne events. This effectively squelched the interest in the retired CathianNavy personnel, and the Light Horse seemed to return to its ancient roots.%0a%0aThere are some who contend that membership in the Light Horse secretly expanded to other important leaders, as if to suggest that the military controlled key people and exerted unnatural influence. Among those accused of being members of this organization was ElkarLemard, a member of the [[Lemardians]]. However, these accusations seem daft in light of the lack of evidence to support. With the exception of the TrilisIncident, the Light Horse appears to have never been more than a bunch of crotchety old battlewagons trying to recapture their youth.%0a%0a!!
