text=%3c%3c|ImperiumEditionIndex|>>%0a%0a(:title Committee of Ten Thousand Flowers:)%0a%0aThe '''Committee of Ten Thousand Flowers''' was a populist group formed during the period leading up to the ill-fated TerranRepublic into the early years of the Imperium. The '''Committee''' formed during the period when former trade routes were re-opened, leading to a turbulant period of sectarianism between the separate enclaves of humanity. The Committee sought to improve understanding between the various once-isolated settlements.%0a%0aThis magnanimous goal was accomplished in large part by establishing cooperation between various universities and think tanks. Students were encouraged to seek degrees in other sectors, many of whom chose to settle in their new-found home. They also sought to create a uniform currency and stablize trade relations. While powerful families were wary of the impact of too much cooperation between their citizenry, they were hard pressed to undermine the Committee's initiatives. Some more powerful families publically embraced, and even served, the Committee, while privately seeking to control and or destroy it.%0a%0aWhile much-deplored by those in politics, the Committee did much to foster unity. Many scholars agree that the Committee's successes led to its eventual outlaw status. As the republic was replaced by the Imperium, the Emperor needed to control the various organizations owned by the Committee to solidify his power. As the Emperor sought control, BenitaPerez was serving her third two-year term as Committee Chairman. At first, the other members of the Premier Committee agreed that resisting the Emperor was in the best interest of the people. The Republic might be lost, but they would not become puppets to the Imperium. %0a%0aWith that consensus, BenitaPerez launched a fierce anti-Imperium campaign. This campaign called for a return to the old sectarian policies that led to unity amongst the worlds, and sought to tighten relations amongst scholars. However, there were members within the Premier Committee who only encouraged Benita's zeal to expose the Committee as a threat to stability under the new Imperium. Under previous governments, such a campaign would be reasonable and tolerated. However, Benita's zeal blinded her to her liability for treason. She died when between systems, en route to a symposium to discuss a new five-year educational plan. The results of her autopsy were disputed when they were first reported. The original records were lost. %0a%0aThe dispute was whether her death was a suicide or a murder. Many resistant to the Imperium claimed she was assassinated by the Emperor. Others, likely at the behest of the Imperial government, suggested that the Committee itself is to blame citing internal rivalries. Trials were held, certain members of the Primer Committee were imprisoned, and the Committee organization itself where "nationalized." Thus controlled by the Imperial government, the Committee's sub-organizations continued to exist throughout the Imperium period. Throughout its Imperial history, the Committee was both an organization that agitated against the Imperial government, and supported it. Several coups were instigated within the Committee. There have even been Emperors who were products of this organization's programs.%0a%0a!! References%0a# BenitaPerez%0a# TerranRepublic%0a%0a[[!ImperiumEdition]] [[!IsaacTaubAuthored]]
