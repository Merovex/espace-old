I shall in this text discuss some of the%0acommon rules that security experts and countermeasures technicians live by.%0a%0aI have found that the best set of rules published to date is by%0aGlen H. Whidden which he draws upon from his 28-year career with the CIA.%0aMr. Whidden, noted as one of the countries most knowledgeable surveillance%0acountermeasures experts details these rules in the books which his company%0aTechnical Services Agency (TSA) publishes.%0a%0aI shall simply reprint these rules from his book  ''A Guidebook for the Beginning Sweeper''.   Mr. Whidden has  lovingly given his rules a name,%0aand that is:  ``The Moscow Rules". I don't  know what it specifically%0ameans. Nothing really, just a clever slogan. but anyway the rules are%0aas follows.%0a%0aMoscow Rules for Counter Espionage Investigations%0a-------------------------------------------------%0a%0a# Assume that all Local Nationals's (LN)are hostile.%0a# Assume that an approach by a non-LN is hostile until proven otherwise.%0a# Assume that there is always hostile physical surveillance unless counter-surveillance proves otherwise.%0a# Assume that all telephone conversations are monitored by LN's.%0a# Assume that all enclosed areas are bugged unless they are 'secure' rooms.%0a# Assume that incoming and outgoing mail will be subject to hostile examination.%0a# Assume that anything that is left unattended will be subject to examination by LN's.%0a# Assume that locks left unguarded or unprotected will be manipulated or bypased and the material they protect will be compromised.%0a# Assume that simple traps will not deceive LN's.%0a# Assume that any guard can be recruited by LN's or is himself an LN agent.%0a# Assume that a pair of guards can be recruited by LN's or are themselves agents of LN's.%0a%0aMoscow Rules for Countermeasures Inspections%0a--------------------------------------------%0a%0a# Assume that the eavesdropper is listening in the sensitve areas.%0a# Assume that an eavesdropper has an agent near the sensitive area.%0a# Assume that the eavesdropper is watching the entrances of the facility.%0a# Assume that the eavesdropper can maintain a low vulnerability status when he is not listening.%0a# Assume that the eavesdropper is guarding the NLJD band of frequencies.%0a# Assume that the eavesdropper is watching for sweep receiver radiation.%0a%0aTranslation into English%0a------------------------%0a%0aMr Whidden, then goes onto explain what each one of the above rules%0ameans in detail, but it is rather long-winded and I wont reprint it%0ain this text.  Most of the rules are very simpe to understand, but%0aa few points warrant explanation which I'll put into my own words so%0aI can explain it in more simplistic terms.%0a%0aLocal Nationals%0a~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%0a%0aThe term  LN (Local National) means a person who is indigenous to a%0aspecific area.  This term has a greater meaning in the field of world%0aintelligence as it means a citizen of a foreign country who may be an%0aagent or informer of that country or it may be a citizen of another%0acountry that you recruit as an ``agent" or "asset" to work for you.%0a%0aHowever, in the context of the Moscow Rules it is simply a term of%0aconvenience which is not nearly so grand. In such context of the rules%0ait refers to a person who may work for an organization or a corporation%0awho is either acting on its own accord or under the direction of others%0aand the purpose of that individual is to infiltrate and or compromise%0athe corporation or organization usually in a covert manner (such as to%0asteal business secrets in industrial espionage), but can be done in an%0aovert manner also if the intent is to destroy or cause harm or embarress%0athe organization.%0a%0a%0aMoscow Rules for Counter Espionage Investigations%0a=================================================%0a%0aRule One%0a~~~~~~~~%0a%0aRule 1 ``Assume all Local Nationals are hostile" translates to the%0aphilosophy of ``trust nobody!" %0aThis can be extended to include the very person who hired you.  %0aThis is a logical conclusion when you strictly construe these rules;%0aespecially in a corporate situation.%0a%0a%0aOne interesting tactic has the security detail request that a TSCM%0acountermeasures sweep be performed. They may request the sweep to%0asatisfy a boss or to make the executives feel that the room is more%0asecure after the sweep so they will have a confidential converation.%0aHowever, one or more of the security detail may be the actual%0aperpetrator and either deactivate or remove the clandestine devices%0abefore the search, and reactivate or replace the device afterwards.%0aWhat makes this tactic more powerful is the target will trust the agent%0afor ordering the sweep. This also makes the agent's cover appear more%0alegitimate becuase he ordered the sweep.%0aOne should consider Moscow Rules 10 & 11 to accept that ``guards" and%0a``security" should not never be given full trust.  %0a%0aThe ``Sweeper" ''must'' obey the security staff, even if the sweeper%0asuspects the guards or security staff as being the actual perpetrators.%0aOnce actual proof reveals that a staffer or guard is an agent, the%0asweeper should convey that possibility to some other person within the%0acompany who the sweeper feels is trustworthy.%0a%0aRule 4%0a~~~~~~%0a%0aRule 4 is an especially important one. ``Assume all telephone%0aconversations are monitored." Although it needs no elaboration, I cannot%0astress how important it is '''never''' to discuss anything sensitive%0aover a telephone. This holds espeicially true when you have a cordless%0aor cellular phone.%0a%0aAlso, it should also be noted in my personal opinion, that not even%0aencrypted phones/faxes should be beyond suspicion. There exists many%0aways to defeat such encryption. The easiest is simply to compromise the%0akeys which is not a difficult task if your target is unaware. A simple%0ablag-bag job is all that is needed to either liberate the codes from the%0aencryption unit itself or from a locked safe or drawer which can then be%0acopied to floppy and the original code returned to its position%0aundisturbed.  Modern encryption units such as the STU phones do help to%0asome small extent to guard against such attacks by the uses of%0a``ignition or code keys" which can be physically taken from the unit to%0ahelp secure the units key integrity, but there are ways around that.%0aThen of course, it is never beyond reason to doubt that the encryption%0aitself can be cracked if it is deemed a priority. This is a mere simple%0atask which can be done in a half a second if your using weak encryption%0aon your phone such as simple ``inversion" chips or other simple%0aencryption units which are widly sold in catalogs.  It is also not out%0aof reason to realize that even DES is not safe anymore, although its a%0ahell of alot safer than ``inversion chips" which can be cracked with a%0a$50 kit available in the classifieds of most electronic magazines.%0a%0aRule 5%0a~~~~~~%0a%0aRule 5 states that all conversations should be considered vulnerable%0aunless conducted in a ``secure" room.   Personally, I hold to the%0aphilosophy that *there is no such thing* as a ``secure" room, but then one%0amust realize that this is reality and you cannot be completely paranoid.%0a%0aA ``secure" room is a complicated term to define as there are many%0adegrees of what is considered ``secure".  The ultimate ``secure" room%0awould be completely RF (Radio Frequency) proof and would thusly%0aattenuate completely all RF transmissions from ``bugs", but the security%0amust be extended to insure that no wires/fiber enter the room or leave%0athe room as they can carry clandestine signals hidden on that wire (or%0aat the very least all wires must be monitored for hidden signals). The%0aroom must have no loudspeakers which can act as microphones, the room%0apreferable would have no windows and if it did would attenute any%0aInfrared light so as to protect against RF/IR transmitters. And lastly%0athe room would be acoustically secure which means there would be%0avirtually no acoustic leakage (in otherwords no sound could be heard on%0athe other side of the wall using any types of devices such as%0amicrophones and high powered amplifiers.) Also, to be acoustically%0asecure, the room should have sufficient random masking signals present%0aand continuously fed into the secure room. There should be several of%0asuch masking generators in use at different points in the room and in%0aaddition all plenums and air vents should be masked as well. In%0aaddition, the walls as well as any windows should be masked using a%0atransducer element which vibrates all windows and walls in a random%0afashion to further defeat any clandestine listening devices such as%0acontact microphones, spike or tube microphones which are drilled into%0athe wall from the opposite non-guarded side, as well as techniques of%0a'laser/microwave pick-off'.%0a%0aRule 8%0a~~~~~~%0a%0aRule 8 also warrants elaboration. All mechanical locking mechanisms are%0aeasily bypassed by persons with experience in such fields - which very%0aoften includes an eavesdropper himself - or on occasion, an eavesdropper%0amay have a  ``keyman"  which is a person who is an entry specialist%0a(called ``quick-entry" in the locksmithing field).%0a%0aTo properly secure a facility electronic locking mechanisms should be%0aused which are much harder (yet not impossible to defeat).  Preferably a%0asecure installation should go beyond simple electronic locking%0amechanisms (such as key card system connected to an electric strike). A%0acomplete access system must be incorporated with full provisions for%0asoftware logging of all entries and exits, as well as ``anti-passback"%0aprotection to further enhance accountability and security and tracking.%0a%0aAll safes should be of the electronic type, NOT the mechanical%0acombination type of yesteryear.  It is not a difficult task to bypass%0acombination safes nowadays.  The top expert safecrackers can ply their%0atrade in an hour to two hours time, and a device now exists on the%0amarket which cracks safes automatically using a computer controlled%0amechanism and does so in approximately 1 hour.  Electronic safes are%0avirtually 100 percent secure and are the current standard on all%0agovernment facilities where classified information is stored. The%0aelectronic safe itself should preferably have accountability and logging%0afeatures built-in with seperate access codes for multiple users of that%0asafe.%0a%0a%0aMOSCOW RULES FOR COUNTERMEASURES INSPECTIONS:%0a---------------------------------------------%0a%0aRule 3%0a~~~~~~%0a%0aRule 3 is a most important one and is something both the countermeasures%0atechnician as well as his client should keep in mind and previously%0adiscuss during the initial client contact. Although it does not suit%0aevery situation, but in many cases it would be wise not to be recognized%0aas a countermeasures technician for obvious reasons.  One does not want%0ato spook the eavesroppers into either shutting their devices off,%0apulling them out temporarily or at worst ``skipping town" never to be%0aheard from, and unlikely to be caught.%0a%0aQ: How does a countermeasures technician arrive at his clients office in a discreet manner?%0a%0aWhen it is deemed necessary, a simple ``disguise" is in order.  The TSCM%0aTech should blend in to look like all other employees, he should look%0aand act like all employees, and in fact NO EMPLOYEES except a select few%0ashould even know the TSCM techs are who they are.  The TSCM tech should%0aarrive in a vehichle preferable a ``work" vehicle which can be disguised%0aas either a maintenance or utility company vehicle.%0a%0aAll equipment should be carried in, under concealment. This means that%0asome type of discreet yet common bag should be used to carry the%0aequipment in.  It is obviously suspicious for a person to carry in 5%0abriefcases (some of them being oversized cases indicating to the%0aeavesdropper that its no ``ordinary" briefcase) into a building.%0a%0aOne tactic I have personally used myself when doing the occasional sweep%0afor a client,  is to arrive in a borrowed van which bears the name of%0asome maintenance company.  My typical motife is to arrive as a%0a``painter" and when I enter the office if its a large office I announce%0amyself as such to the secretary. This of course must be made clear in%0aadvance to the client so that the secretary knows that the  ``painter"%0a(or ``plumber" or ``carpentry contractor" will arrive), again it should%0abe stressed that not even secretaries should be made aware of the TSCM%0aTechs identity or purpose of visit.  All equipment I carry in discreetly%0ain a  painters spackle bag which is just large enough for most of my%0asweep gear. And for my spectrum analyzer which is too large for the%0aspackle bag, I just haul that into the office discreetly wrapped up in a%0alarge painters cloth tarp. %0a%0aUsually I strip the plates off of the van and I remove the inspection%0aand registration sticker so as to avoid being ``checked-out" by an LN%0aagent who may find your van ``suspicous".  This in actuallity IS NOT THE%0aIDEAL METHOD. I merely do that for convenience purposes.  (because I am%0anot rich I cant afford multiple vans and vehicles registered to multiple%0alegitimate ``ghost" companies which all must pay taxes and be registered%0awith the state you do business in.) In fact its better to arrive in a%0avan which  has license plates and registration which is legitimate as%0awell as the company logo painted on the side of the truck belonging to%0aan established legal business. This provides a better degree of cover.%0aAlthough it is very very rare, it should likewise not be considered out%0aof the question that an LN might ckeck out the validity of your company%0a(a simple check of the yellow pages should turn up your company name.%0aand if not...suspicion.)  It doesnt take a genius likewise to figure out%0athat if you see a white van marked  ``Acme Painting Company" parked in%0afront of your target building which you are eavesdropping upon, you%0ashould become suspicious.%0a%0a%0a> (4) Assume that the eavesdropper can maintain a low vulnerability status when he is not listening.%0a%0aWhat rule number 4 deals with, is the eavesdroppers ability to make%0ahimself ``invisible" to the TSCM Technician, Security Staff and his%0aintended ``targets" by various methods too detailed to describe here.%0a%0aThis mainly includes 2 tactics.%0a * shutting the taps or bugs off remotely  (and)%0a * having an LN agent remove the taps/bugs after they are%0a     no longer needed and then promptly replacing them when they%0a     are needed again. It merely takes seconds for an agent who%0a     has access to the facilities to install such devices in the%0a     compromoised area.%0a%0a'''(5) Assume that the eavesdropper is guarding the NLJD band of frequencies.'''%0a%0aThis one is a bit esoteric to the laymen, but the term NLJD refers to%0aa device which is used by countermeasures technician to locate%0aclandestine listening devices which may be buried under concealment%0ainside of a wall, desk, drawer, behind books, buried covertly inside%0aa piece of wood or other structural material which could not be inspected%0aby any other means.%0a%0aThe NLJD works much like a metal detector, only the principle involved is%0aALOT more sophisticated. The device doesnt merely search for metal.%0aRather, it searches for semiconductor junctions such as transistors and%0adiodes which would be present in all ``bugs" (transmitters) as well as%0ain most microphones, etc.  The NLJD is mainly usefull for finding a%0aclandestine device which is NOT ACTIVATED!   This has to do with one of%0athe rules above (Rule #4). The eavesdropper may have the ability to%0aturn the device off remotely or even manually and as such would not%0abe detected with normal RF ``sweeping" gear which looks for an RF/IR signal.%0a(since if the device is OFF, it thusly generates no RF/IR signal).%0a%0aThe NLJD works by transmittng a microwave frequency signal (between%0a800 - 950MHz  [depending on the version, and the laws of the country%0awhich the unit is sold in]. The signal power of these units is%0arelatively low 20mW - 300mW for non-government ("consumer"/industry)%0aversions [legal U.S.A versions a.k.a FCC approved]  and  300mW to approx%0a3 Watts for law enforcement and government units. The greater output power%0aof the government models allows a higher degree of penetration into deeply%0aembedded or dense materials. The typical radiated ouput for a U.S.A. version%0aNLJD is 915MHz and for European versions is often 888.5MHz.%0a%0aSince the unit emits a microwave it thusly radiates through the airwaves%0aand the eavesdropper can thusly detect it using his scanner. A clever%0aeavesdropper will continuously scan the band of frequencies, or a specific%0afrequency if the eavesdropper is relatively sure of the frequency on which%0athe targets NLJD uses. Once the eavesdropper detects the signal, he can then%0aremotely deactivate his clandestine devices.%0a%0aIt should be noted of course, that a clever eavesdropper has at their%0adisposal, a number of uniquely different methods in which to ``fool" an%0aNLJD unit into not detecting the listening device completely, or methods to%0afool the user of the NLJD into believing that the reflected signal is a%0afalse alarm. One example is to modify the casing of the listening device,%0aand RF filter all the leads when done in such a manner that they clandestine%0adevice will reflection a large portion of 3rd harmonics while keeping%0asecondary harmonics to a minimum thus indicating to the NLJD user perhaps%0athat the unit is picking up disimilar metals (sheetrock screws, nails, rebar,%0aetc.) rather than semiconductors.%0a%0aI shall not detail these particular processes as its irrelevant and unwise%0abut if anyone actually cares to know the methods are I can discuss that with%0ayou in more detail if you ask.%0a%0a'''(6) Assume that the eavesdropper is watching for sweep receiver radiation.'''%0a%0aThis is a bit more esoteric and its something which I dont feel is%0aany great threat. But their might be some government experts in the%0afield who are a bit more sophisticated who would say otherwise. But%0ain a real life situation I dont see it happening unless the%0aeavesdropper is himself a former government employee.%0a%0aALL electronic equipment generates EMI (Electromagnetic Interference)%0awhich is essentially spurious radiation emmited unintentionally. As such%0athese radio wave emmisions are also generated from any type of ``sweep"%0aequipment which the countermeasures technician may use.%0aA sophisticated eavesdropper can detect these spurious emmisions and%0atake it as a sign that sweep equipment is being used and the sweep is%0anow in progress. The eavesdropper then shuts his clandestine devices%0aoff remotely.%0a%0aIn reality the ability to do this is actually quite simple. Its just%0athat I find it unrealistic and I dont think many buggist in this country%0ago to all that trouble. Not unless its a super sophisticated operation,%0aor unless the eavesdropper is being payed well to take such precautions.%0aBut then super sophisticated operations are not the norm. Not even close.%0aUsually the bugging is done by amateurs using crude bugging equipment%0awhich is easily detected, and is not even concealed well on top of it.%0aMost bugging devices are usually not even remotely activated and likewise%0atheir usually not protected against NLJD sweeps either, unless the person%0awho is doing the eavesdropping is a pro which is rarely the case.%0a%0aMoscow Rules for Telephone System Inspections%0a---------------------------------------------%0a%0a# Assume that the eavesdropper is listening to room sounds through the telephone instrument until tests prove otherwise.%0a%0a# Assume that the eavesdropper is listening across the line when the line is active.%0a%0a# Assume that the eavesdropper may be monitoring the line when it is inactive.%0a%0a# Assume that the eavesdropper is monitoring the line to detect TDR and RF tracing signals.%0a%0aMoscow Rules for Telephone System Inspections:%0a----------------------------------------------%0a%0a# The eavesdropper has a variety of techniques at his disposal which enable him to listen to 'room sounds' ("room audio" [note 1]) from a remote location. I will not discuss that in detail, because all the techniques involved in telephone and wireline attacks could fill an entire book in itself.  Generally however, their are two main techniques that could be employed. [Their are actually another 3 or 4 techniques but I shant get into discussing those for the sake of brevity.]%0a%0a## 'Hot-miked telephone' otherwise called a 'Hot-On-Hook telephone' is one method, which involves modifying an actual telephone which is in a targets location (in reality, the targets phone itself is not modified, but an identical replacement is brought in and switched with the original [this technique of switching phones of course warrants caution as the target could possibly notice the difference between the two by noting scuff marks, etc. that were on the original phone]. The modification consists of a circuit that will allow the eavesdropper to listen to room sounds while the phone is still ``on-hook". The modification ``drops-out" once the phone is picked up for use and is brought ``off-hook" (in which case, the eavesdropper would then have a seperate circuit which could monitor the phone conversation.%0a%0a## The second most common method is called an ``infinity transmitter", which in the 'olden days' circa 1960/70 was called a ``harmonica bug".  This is a slight variation of the hot-miked telephone. It is similar in that it allows a person to listen to room audio from a remote location, however the system employed need not be part of the actual telephone. The device could be hidden anywhere along the phone line in close proximity to the target where a seperate microphone can listen to room audio which is then sent through the phone lines while the phone is 'on-hook'. When the phone is lifted 'off-hook', the device drops-out. The device is activated remotely by the eavesdropper by simply calling the targets phone line and then activating the device.%0a%0aRoom sounds could also be monitored by simply placing a microphone%0aacross any line pair, preferably a line pair which is not currently%0aactivated for phone useage (ie: the second yellow-black pair.) This%0awould allow constant monitoring of the room audio even when the target%0auses the phone (which would be on line pair 1 (red-green) and thusly%0awould not conflict. The microphone could either generate its own signal%0a9which has the disadvantage of being easier to detect because the%0amicrophone transmits constantly , or could use a microphone element%0awhich requires an external voltage such as in a carbon mic.  In the case%0aof carbon microphones, the eavesdropper need only apply a small voltage%0ato the line and the microphone will activate sending intercepted audio%0adown the line. The device has the advantage that it is slightly harder%0ato detect (especially inadvertently) because the unit only operates when%0athe eavesdropper has the device activated.  Countermeasures technicians%0acan find the device (in its simplest form) easy enough by just applying%0avoltage to the line. But more sophisticated set-ups would utilize a%0a4-layer diode, SCR, or a reverse polarity configuration or some other%0amethod to hinder and thwart detection.%0a%0a'''(2) Rule 2 is fairly obvious and needs little explanation. Always%0aassume that a phone line can be, or currently is being monitored.'''%0a%0aIt is very important for the laymen to make the distinction between the%0atwo facts in the above statement which are:%0a%0a* the phone/line ``could" be tapped.%0a* the phone/line ``is being" tapped.%0a%0aIt does not make one paranoid to come to the conclusion and realization%0athat a phone ``could" be tapped. It merely makes one alert and an%0ainformed individual.  That does not mean that one should insist that a%0aline ``is" tapped, but it should simply be considered a possibilty which%0aone must take into consideration and act accordingly on.%0a%0aThusly, if one conducts confidential business in which it would be of%0aimportant consequence to keep the conversation from prying ears of the%0aeavesdropper, one should always employ end-to-end encryption through the%0ause of telephone/fascimile ``scramblers". [note 2]%0a%0aOne must make the decision for themselves regarding what is to be kept%0asecret and what can be disclosed, and you must come to some sort of plan%0aof action regarding what the different levels of confidentiality are.%0aSome secrets are worth keeping more than others. In fact one might even%0asay some secrets are so great that you should not disclose them to%0aanyone ever. That would be the ultimate form of security. As an example,%0aif you had just murdered someone, obviously any sane individual should%0anot announce that over the phone lines, no matter how secure you feel%0athat phone line is. Because their is no degree of security which is%0aworth 25 years in prison or death. Even encryption (phone scramblers)%0ashould not be considered secure in such cases as they can be compromised%0arather easily by simply bypassing the encryption altogether through%0amodification by the eavesdropper, or by simply liberating the code keys%0afrom the unit (which is a simple task with some encryption units while%0aalot more difficult in the better units.)%0a%0aWhenever a line pair is to be examined or traced (for maintenance%0apurposes such as working on a phone or computer network in an office%0aor home, or when a countermeasures search is being done, it is preferable%0athat ``audio" signals of a strange nature (line tracing signals) should%0aNOT be placed across the line as they would be suspicious to an eavesdropper%0ain which case the eavesdropper might deactivate remotely any devices%0awhich he may have installed which could put the devices in a low-profile%0astatus making them more difficult to detect.%0a%0aSo how then does one trace a line without using an ``audible line tracer"%0aas is the standard method among technicians?  The alternative is to%0ause either an RF (Radio Frequency) tracer system which is relatively%0ainexpensive (and also has many advatages over audible tracers such as%0athe ability to track wires through walls without having to open up the wall%0aor structure for physical examination) or one could utilize an ``ultrasonic"%0atracer device which sends an inaudible signal down the line. These%0aaultrasonic tracers are an indespensible tool which come in two forms.%0aThe first is simply a aultrasonic tone tracer and merely produces a%0asingle tone for identifying line pairs. The second type of ultrasonic%0adevice actually modulates a voice signals onto a wire pair so that it%0ais inaudible and above both the range of human hearing and likewise%0acannot be picked up by either microphones of any type and cannot be%0ademodulated by any type of standard amplifier unit which is not designed%0ato amplify sounds above the standard human hearing/speaking range.%0aOnly a specialized matching ultrasonic demodulation amplifier can%0aintercept and convert the signals back into the human hearing range.%0a%0aKeep in mind with the above however, that rule #3 below shall apply.%0aRule #3 states that the eavesdropper ``may" be able to hear your line%0atracing with the phone on-hook.  So one has to balance this%0aconsideration out. Nine times out of Ten you would be better off sending%0athese signals down the line because most eavesdroppers DO NOT monitor%0aa phone which is on-hook, nor do they look for signals on inactive lines%0a(not unless they are professionals, or are simply getting payed alot%0aof money to do that extra work which is often unnecessary).%0aBut if your up against a sophisticated eavesdropper and you know of%0ahis capabilities it would probably be wise in such case NOT to send any%0astrange signals down a wire pair other than ordinary phone conversations.%0a%0a%0a(3) Most of the time, telephone surveillance, whether it be the%0a    interception of phone conversations where the phone is off-hook,%0a    or even monitoring of room conversations when the line is on-hook%0a    involves the use of some sort of ``activation" device which records%0a    the conversations when and only when those conversations are present.%0a    When the conversation ceases the device will shut itself off (usually)%0a    so as to conserve tape (and in addition make it easier for the%0a    eavesdropper to find the conversations in the recorded tapes.%0a%0aWhen dealing with recording telephone calls, a device is used which%0amonitors the voltage on the line for off-hook/on-hook conditions and%0athen activates a special tape recorder (with a remote activation jack)%0awhen the phone goes off-hook. [although a more clever eavesdropper would%0anot use such a device but would rather use a VOX (voice [sound level]%0aactivated unit as opposed a voltage sensing unit which can actually be%0a``tricked" as well as ``detected" alot more easily which should be%0acoupled to an inductive pick-up coil (or at the least a high-impedance%0acapacitively coupled interface). VOX units too also have their problems,%0anamely they can have havoc wreaked upon them by the use of masking%0adevices or ``telephone security units" which are now widely sold on the%0amarket for a couple hundred dollars. These telephone security units have%0athe ability to defeat most simple eavesdropping methods utilizing%0atechniques such as masking as well as ``Line Balancing". The latter%0atechnique of balancing performed by raising the voltage, while the%0acurrent is simultaneously lowered.  Such a technique does not interfere%0awith the PSTN Central Office and will give the user a dial-tone when the%0aline is raised off-hook(600 Ohms) and will thusly defeats most voltage%0aactivated devices such as simple telephone tap transmistters as well as%0adrop-out relays (telephone recorder controllers).%0a%0aThe foolish individual could conclude that if most eavesdroppers used a%0avoltage activated device that only recorded audio when the phone was%0a``off-hook", then the line should be secured in an ``on-hook" condition.%0aExample, a person could then transmit his voice within the household or%0aoffice while the phone was still ``on-hook" using a relatively simple%0acircuit to do that and ``supposedly" that would alow for safe%0aconversation, and it would be safe ``if" a voltage activated telephone%0arecording adapter was used.  However, many eavesdroppers (sophisticated%0aones) may be a bit more clever than that. The clever eavesdropper may%0amonitor a line pair even when it is inactive (such as when a phone is%0a``on-hook".) This would allow the eavesdropper to hear  ``AUDIO" [note%0a1] even when the phone is off-hook.  Note I use the word AUDIO very%0acarefully. Because in such an instance, the eavsdropper may NOT just be%0alistening to secret conversations which occur ``on-hook" but he may be%0alistening to other audio which could be a potential threat to the%0aeavesdropper such a the sounds of audible line tracing, ultrasonic line%0atracing or ultrasonic voice modulation, as well as RF tracing, and%0alastly the eavesdropper could be looking for the signals emmenating from%0aa TDR (see rule #4 explanation).%0a%0a%0a(4) The last rule is a rather esoterical one which is of more concern to%0athe countermeasures technician who is performing the search as opposed%0ato concern of your ordinary individual or businessman concerned with the%0arules to insuring privacy.%0a%0aRule #4 is just a follow up to rule #3 which states that an eavesdropper%0acould possibly be monitoring the inactive line pair. In rule #4 we get%0aspecific in saying that an eavesdropper may be looking for RF signals or%0aTDR signals which may be an indication of a countermeasures ``sweep"%0awhich is being conducted. This should concern the eavesdropper for%0aobvious reasons, which are that he could possibly be discovered very%0asoon if the technician is a competant one, or if the eavesdroppers%0aset-up is crude or poorly installed in which case it could possibly be%0adetected.%0a%0aI have already explained ultrasonic and RF tracing above in rule 3, so%0aI'll just deal with TDR's.%0a%0aA TDR is common abbreviation for a device known as a Time Domain%0aReflectometer. You pronounce the units name by simply saying the%0aletters.   ``T" - ``D" - ``R".%0a%0aThe TDR is a common tool of anyone who works exensively with wires (or%0afiber optic cabling) of any type. The type of TDR we are discussing is%0aonly for the ``wire" and not ``fiber optic" type.  TDR's are used by%0acable company technicians, computer network technicians, telephone%0alineman or repair personell, as well as surveillance countermeasures%0atechnicians.%0a%0aA TDR is a device (usually a hand-held size device although slightly%0alarger and more powerfull bench-top units are available) which emits a%0amild powered signal into a wire pair. This signal gets sent down a wire%0apair, or through a coaxial cable and gets partially reflected off of any%0adiscontinuity on the line pair. Herein, I'll refer to any discontinuous%0areflections as an ``anomaly" on the wire. I use the word as opposed to%0adiscontinuity (because its easier to type) and because much like an%0aanomoly it is indicative of the unknown. And thats what your looking for%0awhen doing a TSCM TDR sweep of a wire pair.  Your looking for unknown or%0astrange situations.  It is these anomalies which the technician is%0alooking for which are a possible source of the problem (or could even%0aindicate that everything is normal if their is supposed to be an anomoly%0aat some point).%0a%0aThe word ``anomaly" is a generic term which refers to anything on the%0aline which will interfere with the signal going through the line.  To%0aput it another way, it is something which causes part of the signal to%0aliterally reflect backwards from the point of origin instead of%0atraveling freely and smoothly through the wire.%0a%0aThis ``reflection" of the signal is what the TDR is looking to receive%0aafter it emits the original pulse. The reflection which could be of%0avarying degrees of intensity depending on how large the anomaly is.  The%0alarger the anomaly, the larger the reflection, and occasionaly that%0ameans the bigger the problem. Ideally the signal is supposed to travel%0athrough the wire impeded as little as possible.  Anomalies are caused by%0aa wide variety of things too great to discuss here. They can be caused%0aby imperfections in the wire itself, they can be caused by splices in%0athe line, they can be caused by ``connectors" on a wireline which join 2%0awires together or a wire to a piece of equipment. Anomalies can be%0acaused by ``termination plugs" which are a dummy loads placed at the end%0aof a unused wirepair. Anomalies can also be caused by physical hardware%0aon the line such as splitters, filters, junction boxes, 66/110blocks,%0aentrance bridges, and the list can go on and on.%0a%0aThe countermeasures technician is primarily interested in looking for%0athings such as splices on the line which could be indicative of a%0atelephone tap.  Keep in mind, that the word ``splice" does not%0anecessarily preclude that a line was physically ``spliced" (ie: cut and%0athen re-connected.) It also can imply a simple ``tap" on the line where%0aone wire (alligator clip, etc.) is touching upon the original wireline.%0aTDR's have a typical range of 1,000 - 10,000 feet. A typical handheld%0aTDR used by computer network installers will have ranges of 1,000 - 2k%0afeet. Countermeasures technicians often utilize slightly more powerfull%0amodels extending 2,000 - 5,000 feet so they can have the ability to%0atrace large amounts of wires present in office buildings. And benchmodel%0aunits which are usually the most powerfull (although some handheld units%0aare capable of such) can extend upwards of 10,000 or more feet.  These%0aunits can pinpoint  ``flaws" or ``anomalies" on a wireline to a%0aresolution of millimeters which makes them damned accurate devices which%0acan tell you exactly where the flaw is down the line. (typically however%0ain high powered devices the resolution is limited to feet or meters).%0a%0aThe TDR is most effective when it is used on a routine basis and a%0aday-to-day (or more likely week-to-week or moth-to-month) comparison can%0abe made between the different or same results.  Ideally, the results of%0athe TDR should always be the same.  Should a result be significantly%0adifferent on one occasion, or something appears to have been%0aspliced/tapped onto the line it will be readily apparent.%0a%0aOf course for the TDR test to be most effective, it should be realized%0athat the initial tests of the TDR must be done when the line was%0a``clean".  If the line was tapped in the first place the first time you%0atested it, then all subsequent comparisons thereafter are of little use%0abecause you cant compare a ``clean" like with a ``tapped" line.%0a%0aHowever, that factor doesnt render a TDR test completely useless.  One%0adoes not necessarily rely solely on the technique of comparison from one%0atime to another.  Other methods exist for using the TDR which are a%0acombination of tracing the line physically with the TDR from the demarc%0apoint inwards to the telephone instruments and physically searching the%0aline for taps/splices in conjunction with the use of voltmeters or%0atelephone analyzers to search for imbalanced loops, or imbalanced lines%0ato ground, crossed line pairs as well as suspicious line impedances.%0aLikewise, the search should occur from the demarc point outwards towards%0athe telephone company as far as one can go. The search should extend out%0athe end of the customers property,  but a countermeasures technician who%0adoes not mind breaking a few laws might feel free to extend the test%0apoint up to the neighborhood cross connect cabinets where the%0adistribution cable meets the feeders.%0a%0a[note 1]%0a%0aIn surveillance lingo, the word ``AUDIO" is often used as opposed to the%0aword ``SOUND" or ``CONVERSATION". The meanings are almost synonymous,%0abut their is a slight difference.  The word ``audio" is used because it%0adenotes any type of intelligence which could be collected and is not%0alimited to intercepting spoken conversations (spoken words). %0a%0a[note 2]%0a%0aEven encryption (phone scramblers) should not be considered secure as%0athey can be compromised rather easily by simply bypassing the encryption%0aaltogether through modification of the telephone instrument by the%0aeavesdropper, or by simply liberating the code keys from the unit.%0a%0a%0aWHAT THIS MEANS TO YOU AND ME%0a=============================%0a%0aOne may ponder the question of  ``what the hell does this article have%0ato do at all with me?"%0aHow does this concern you if you don't run a company?%0aHow does this concern you if you are not doing anything illegal?%0aHow does this conern you if you believe your not a target being watched?%0a%0aI have no answer.

These are terms which you%0amay run across one day if you work in the field of general security, and%0ayou will thusly be able to speak a bit more authoritatively to your%0acolleagues who may not know much about espionage.%0a%0aBut if you have any respect for your own privacy, then you should heed%0asome of the advice discussed herein.%0a%0aYou need not be a corporate executive to realize the need not only for your%0aprivacy but the need to recognize how many people by their own acts%0acontribute to the privacy violations. They do this by using cordless phones,%0acellular phones, by using paging beepers and even by holding confidential%0aconversations on unsecured phone lines instead of in person.%0a%0aI write this specific article for those people on computer bulletin%0aboard systems, and this is aimed SPECIFICALLY at those who refer to%0athemselves as ``computer hackers"   or  ``telephone phreaks". If you do not recognize the value in this article then you are a great fool indeed.%0a%0aRemember folks. Paranoia is our friend. You never know who is watching%0aor listening.   Always assume the worst and thusly disclose the least%0ayou can; even to so-called friends.%0a%0a----%0a%0aNever discuss anything illegal over a telephone be it landline or cordless.%0a%0aNever keep any incriminating material at your home. Or at the very least%0aany such information if illegal, should not be 'feloniously' illegal.%0a%0aNever discuss any majorly illegal acts (in my book thats defined as anything%0athats a felony) with anyone else, even friends. And if you do, then you%0ashould be sufficiently vague and even intentionally misleading to your%0afriends so as to give the eavesdroppers ``misiformation".%0a%0aNever disclose to any friend the full capabilities of your power, your%0aknowledge, etc. If necessary intentionally mislead those friends by%0aoverstating or understating your capabilities or knowledge in order to%0afeed misinformation to an eavesdropper. This can be done to ``spook" your%0aeavesdropper and make them enact a move prematurely, or to make them%0abelieve what you want them to believe for whatever reason you see fit.%0aIn addition, feed just enough thruthfull information so as to 'whet the%0aappetite' of the eavesdropper and not give away your conversation as%0atotal obvious misinformation.%0a%0a(:comment This page has been edited using Pywe:)

The%0a%3c room must have no loudspeakers which can act as microphones, the room%0a%3c preferable would have no windows and if it did would attenute any%0a%3c Infrared light so as to protect against RF/IR transmitters. And lastly%0a%3c the room would be acoustically secure which means their would be%0a%3c virtually no acoustic leakage (in otherwords no sound could be heard on%0a%3c the other side of the wall using any types of devices such as%0a%3c microphones and high powered amplifiers.) Also, to be acoustically%0a%3c secure, the room should have sufficient random masking signals present%0a%3c and continuously fed into the secure room. Their should be several of%0a%3c such masking generators in use at different points in the room and in%0a%3c addition all plenums and air vents should be masked as well. In%0a%3c addition, the walls as well as any windows should be masked using a%0a%3c transducer element which vibrates all windows and walls in a random%0a%3c fashion to further defeat any clandestine listening devices such as%0a%3c contact microphones, spike or tube microphones which are drilled into%0a%3c the wall from the opposite non-guarded side, as well as techniques of%0a%3c 'laser/microwave pick-off'.%0a%3c %0a%3c Rule 8%0a%3c ~~~~~~%0a%3c %0a%3c Rule 8 also warrants elaboration.

I will not discuss that in detail, because all the techniques involved in telephone and wireline attacks could fill an entire book in itself.  Generally however, their are two main techniques that could be employed. [Their are actually another 3 or 4 techniques but I shant get into discussing those for the sake of brevity.]%0a%3c %0a%3c ## 'Hot-miked telephone' otherwise called a 'Hot-On-Hook telephone' is one method, which involves modifying an actual telephone which is in a targets location (in reality, the targets phone itself is not modified, but an identical replacement is brought in and switched with the original [this technique of switching phones of course warrants caution as the target could possibly notice the difference between the two by noting scuff marks, etc. that were on the original phone]. The modification consists of a circuit that will allow the eavesdropper to listen to room sounds while the phone is still ``on-hook". The modification ``drops-out" once the phone is picked up for use and is brought ``off-hook" (in which case, the eavesdropper would then have a seperate circuit which could monitor the phone conversation.%0a%3c %0a%3c ## The second most common method is called an ``infinity transmitter", which in the 'olden days' circa 1960/70 was called a ``harmonica bug".  This is a slight variation of the hot-miked telephone. It is similar in that it allows a person to listen to room audio from a remote location, however the system employed need not be part of the actual telephone. The device could be hidden anywhere along the phone line in close proximity to the target where a seperate microphone can listen to room audio which is then sent through the phone lines while the phone is 'on-hook'. When the phone is lifted 'off-hook', the device drops-out. The device is activated remotely by the eavesdropper by simply calling the targets phone line and then activating the device.%0a%3c %0a%3c Room sounds could also be monitored by simply placing a microphone%0a%3c across any line pair, preferably a line pair which is not currently%0a%3c activated for phone useage (ie: the second yellow-black pair.) This%0a%3c would allow constant monitoring of the room audio even when the target%0a%3c uses the phone (which would be on line pair 1 (red-green) and thusly%0a%3c would not conflict. The microphone could either generate its own signal%0a%3c 9which has the disadvantage of being easier to detect because the%0a%3c microphone transmits constantly , or could use a microphone element%0a%3c which requires an external voltage such as in a carbon mic.  In the case%0a%3c of carbon microphones, the eavesdropper need only apply a small voltage%0a%3c to the line and the microphone will activate sending intercepted audio%0a%3c down the line. The device has the advantage that it is slightly harder%0a%3c to detect (especially inadvertently) because the unit only operates when%0a%3c the eavesdropper has the device activated.  Countermeasures technicians%0a%3c can find the device (in its simplest form) easy enough by just applying%0a%3c voltage to the line. But more sophisticated set-ups would utilize a%0a%3c 4-layer diode, SCR, or a reverse polarity configuration or some other%0a%3c method to hinder and thwart detection.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''(2) Rule 2 is fairly obvious and needs little explanation. Always%0a%3c assume that a phone line can be, or currently is being monitored.'''%0a%3c %0a%3c It is very important for the laymen to make the distinction between the%0a%3c two facts in the above statement which are:%0a%3c %0a%3c * the phone/line ``could" be tapped.%0a%3c * the phone/line ``is being" tapped.%0a%3c %0a%3c It does not make one paranoid to come to the conclusion and realization%0a%3c that a phone ``could" be tapped. It merely makes one alert and an%0a%3c informed individual.  That does not mean that one should insist that a%0a%3c line ``is" tapped, but it should simply be considered a possibilty which%0a%3c one must take into consideration and act accordingly on.%0a%3c %0a%3c Thusly, if one conducts confidential business in which it would be of%0a%3c important consequence to keep the conversation from prying ears of the%0a%3c eavesdropper, one should always employ end-to-end encryption through the%0a%3c use of telephone/fascimile ``scramblers". [note 2]%0a%3c %0a%3c One must make the decision for themselves regarding what is to be kept%0a%3c secret and what can be disclosed, and you must come to some sort of plan%0a%3c of action regarding what the different levels of confidentiality are.%0a%3c Some secrets are worth keeping more than others. In fact one might even%0a%3c say some secrets are so great that you should not disclose them to%0a%3c anyone ever. That would be the ultimate form of security.

Because their is no degree of security which is%0a%3c worth 25 years in prison or death. Even encryption (phone scramblers)%0a%3c should not be considered secure in such cases as they can be compromised%0a%3c rather easily by simply bypassing the encryption altogether through%0a%3c modification by the eavesdropper, or by simply liberating the code keys%0a%3c from the unit (which is a simple task with some encryption units while%0a%3c alot more difficult in the better units.)%0a%3c %0a---%0a> %0a> %0a> MOSCOW RULES FOR TELEPHONE SYSTEM INSPECTIONS%0a> =============================================%0a> %0a> (1) Assume that the eavesdropper is listening to room sounds through%0a>     the telephone instrument until tests prove otherwise.%0a> %0a> (2) Assume that the eavesdropper is listening across the%0a>     line when the line is active.%0a> %0a> (3) Assume that the eavesdropper may be monitoring the%0a>     line when it is inactive.%0a> %0a> (4) Assume that the eavesdropper is monitoring the line%0a>     to detect TDR and RF tracing signals.%0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> MOSCOW RULES FOR TELEPHONE SYSTEM INSPECTIONS:%0a> %0a> (1) The eavesdropper has a variety of techniques at his disposal which%0a>     enable him to listen to 'room sounds' ("room audio" [note 1]) from a%0a>     remote location.

[Their are actually another 3 or 4 techniques but%0a>     I shant get into discussing those for the sake of brevity.]%0a> %0a>   [a] 'Hot-miked telephone' otherwise called a 'Hot-On-Hook telephone'%0a>       is one method, which involves modifying an actual telephone which%0a>       is in a targets location (in reality, the targets phone itself is%0a>       not modified, but an identical replacement is brought in and switched%0a>       with the original [this technique of switching phones of course%0a>       warrants caution as the target could possibly notice the difference%0a>       between the two by noting scuff marks, etc. that were on the%0a>       original phone]. The modification consists of a circuit that will%0a>       allow the eavesdropper to listen to room sounds while the phone%0a>       is still ``on-hook". The modification ``drops-out" once the phone%0a>       is picked up for use and is brought ``off-hook" (in which case,%0a>       the eavesdropper would then have a seperate circuit which could%0a>       monitor the phone conversation.%0a> %0a>   [b] The second most common method is called an ``infinity transmitter",%0a>       which in the 'olden days' circa 1960/70 was called a ``harmonica bug".%0a>       This is a slight variation of the hot-miked telephone. It is%0a>       similar in that it allows a person to listen to room audio from%0a>       a remote location, however the system employed need not be part of%0a>       the actual telephone. The device could be hidden anywhere along the%0a>       phone line in close proximity to the target where a seperate%0a>       microphone can listen to room audio which is then sent through the%0a>       phone lines while the phone is 'on-hook'. When the phone is lifted%0a>       'off-hook', the device drops-out. The device is activated remotely%0a>       by the eavesdropper by simply calling the targets phone line and%0a>       then activating the device.%0a> %0a>       Room sounds could also be monitored by simply placing a microphone%0a>       across any line pair, preferably a line pair which is not currently%0a>       activated for phone useage (ie: the second yellow-black pair.)%0a>       This would allow constant monitoring of the room audio even when the%0a>       target uses the phone (which would be on line pair 1 (red-green)%0a>       and thusly would not conflict. The microphone could either generate%0a>       its own signal 9which has the disadvantage of being easier to detect%0a>       because the microphone transmits constantly , or could use a microphone%0a>       element which requires an external voltage such as in a carbon mic.%0a>       In the case of carbon microphones, the eavesdropper need only apply%0a>       a small voltage to the line and the microphone will activate sending%0a>       intercepted audio down the line. The device has the advantage that it%0a>       is slightly harder to detect (especially inadvertently) because the unit%0a>       only operates when the eavesdropper has the device activated.%0a>       Countermeasures technicians can find the device (in its simplest form)%0a>       easy enough by just applying voltage to the line. But more sophisticated%0a>       set-ups would utilize a 4-layer diode, SCR, or a reverse polarity%0a>       configuration or some other method to hinder and thwart detection.%0a> %0a> (2) Rule 2 is fairly obvious and needs little explanation. Always assume%0a>     that a phone line can be, or currently is being monitored.%0a> %0a>     It is very important for the laymen to make the distinction between%0a>     the two facts in the above statement which are:%0a> %0a>          [a] the phone/line ``could" be tapped.%0a>          [b] the phone/line ``is being" tapped.%0a> %0a>     It does not make one paranoid to come to the conclusion and realization%0a>     that a phone ``could" be tapped. It merely makes one alert and an%0a>     informed individual.  That does not mean that one should insist%0a>     that a line ``is" tapped, but it should simply be considered a possibilty%0a>     which one must take into consideration and act accordingly on.%0a> %0a>     Thusly, if one conducts confidential business in which it would be%0a>     of important consequence to keep the conversation from prying ears%0a>     of the eavesdropper, one should always employ end-to-end encryption%0a>     through the use of telephone/fascimile ``scramblers". [note 2]%0a> %0a>     One must make the decision for themselves regarding what is to%0a>     be kept secret and what can be disclosed, and you must come to%0a>     some sort of plan of action regarding what the different levels%0a>     of confidentiality are. Some secrets are worth keeping more than%0a>     others. In fact one might even say some secrets are so great that%0a>     you should not disclose them to anyone ever. That would be the%0a>     ultimate form of security. As an example, if you had just%0a>     murdered someone, obviously any sane individual should not announce%0a>     that over the phone lines, no matter how secure you feel that phone%0a>     line is. Because their is no degree of security which is worth%0a>     25 years in prison or death. Even encryption (phone scramblers)%0a>     should not be considered secure in such cases as they can be%0a>     compromised rather easily by simply bypassing the encryption%0a>     altogether through modification by the eavesdropper, or by simply%0a>     liberating the code keys from the unit (which is a simple task with%0a>     some encryption units while alot more difficult in the better units.)%0a> %0a484,651c517,690%0a%3c When dealing with recording telephone calls, a device is used which%0a%3c monitors the voltage on the line for off-hook/on-hook conditions and%0a%3c then activates a special tape recorder (with a remote activation jack)%0a%3c when the phone goes off-hook. [although a more clever eavesdropper would%0a%3c not use such a device but would rather use a VOX (voice [sound level]%0a%3c activated unit as opposed a voltage sensing unit which can actually be%0a%3c ``tricked" as well as ``detected" alot more easily which should be%0a%3c coupled to an inductive pick-up coil (or at the least a high-impedance%0a%3c capacitively coupled interface). VOX units too also have their problems,%0a%3c namely they can have havoc wreaked upon them by the use of masking%0a%3c devices or ``telephone security units" which are now widely sold on the%0a%3c market for a couple hundred dollars. These telephone security units have%0a%3c the ability to defeat most simple eavesdropping methods utilizing%0a%3c techniques such as masking as well as ``Line Balancing". The latter%0a%3c technique of balancing performed by raising the voltage, while the%0a%3c current is simultaneously lowered.  Such a technique does not interfere%0a%3c with the PSTN Central Office and will give the user a dial-tone when the%0a%3c line is raised off-hook(600 Ohms) and will thusly defeats most voltage%0a%3c activated devices such as simple telephone tap transmistters as well as%0a%3c drop-out relays (telephone recorder controllers).%0a%3c %0a%3c The foolish individual could conclude that if most eavesdroppers used a%0a%3c voltage activated device that only recorded audio when the phone was%0a%3c ``off-hook", then the line should be secured in an ``on-hook" condition.%0a%3c Example, a person could then transmit his voice within the household or%0a%3c office while the phone was still ``on-hook" using a relatively simple%0a%3c circuit to do that and ``supposedly" that would alow for safe%0a%3c conversation, and it would be safe ``if" a voltage activated telephone%0a%3c recording adapter was used.  However, many eavesdroppers (sophisticated%0a%3c ones) may be a bit more clever than that. The clever eavesdropper may%0a%3c monitor a line pair even when it is inactive (such as when a phone is%0a%3c ``on-hook".) This would allow the eavesdropper to hear  ``AUDIO" [note%0a%3c 1] even when the phone is off-hook.  Note I use the word AUDIO very%0a%3c carefully. Because in such an instance, the eavsdropper may NOT just be%0a%3c listening to secret conversations which occur ``on-hook" but he may be%0a%3c listening to other audio which could be a potential threat to the%0a%3c eavesdropper such a the sounds of audible line tracing, ultrasonic line%0a%3c tracing or ultrasonic voice modulation, as well as RF tracing, and%0a%3c lastly the eavesdropper could be looking for the signals emmenating from%0a%3c a TDR (see rule #4 explanation).%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (4) The last rule is a rather esoterical one which is of more concern to%0a%3c the countermeasures technician who is performing the search as opposed%0a%3c to concern of your ordinary individual or businessman concerned with the%0a%3c rules to insuring privacy.%0a%3c %0a%3c Rule #4 is just a follow up to rule #3 which states that an eavesdropper%0a%3c could possibly be monitoring the inactive line pair. In rule #4 we get%0a%3c specific in saying that an eavesdropper may be looking for RF signals or%0a%3c TDR signals which may be an indication of a countermeasures ``sweep"%0a%3c which is being conducted. This should concern the eavesdropper for%0a%3c obvious reasons, which are that he could possibly be discovered very%0a%3c soon if the technician is a competant one, or if the eavesdroppers%0a%3c set-up is crude or poorly installed in which case it could possibly be%0a%3c detected.%0a%3c %0a%3c I have already explained ultrasonic and RF tracing above in rule 3, so%0a%3c I'll just deal with TDR's.%0a%3c %0a%3c A TDR is common abbreviation for a device known as a Time Domain%0a%3c Reflectometer. You pronounce the units name by simply saying the%0a%3c letters.   ``T" - ``D" - ``R".%0a%3c %0a%3c The TDR is a common tool of anyone who works exensively with wires (or%0a%3c fiber optic cabling) of any type. The type of TDR we are discussing is%0a%3c only for the ``wire" and not ``fiber optic" type.  TDR's are used by%0a%3c cable company technicians, computer network technicians, telephone%0a%3c lineman or repair personell, as well as surveillance countermeasures%0a%3c technicians.%0a%3c %0a%3c A TDR is a device (usually a hand-held size device although slightly%0a%3c larger and more powerfull bench-top units are available) which emits a%0a%3c mild powered signal into a wire pair. This signal gets sent down a wire%0a%3c pair, or through a coaxial cable and gets partially reflected off of any%0a%3c discontinuity on the line pair. Herein, I'll refer to any discontinuous%0a%3c reflections as an ``anomaly" on the wire. I use the word as opposed to%0a%3c discontinuity (because its easier to type) and because much like an%0a%3c anomoly it is indicative of the unknown. And thats what your looking for%0a%3c when doing a TSCM TDR sweep of a wire pair.  Your looking for unknown or%0a%3c strange situations.  It is these anomalies which the technician is%0a%3c looking for which are a possible source of the problem (or could even%0a%3c indicate that everything is normal if their is supposed to be an anomoly%0a%3c at some point).%0a%3c %0a%3c The word ``anomaly" is a generic term which refers to anything on the%0a%3c line which will interfere with the signal going through the line.  To%0a%3c put it another way, it is something which causes part of the signal to%0a%3c literally reflect backwards from the point of origin instead of%0a%3c traveling freely and smoothly through the wire.%0a%3c %0a%3c This ``reflection" of the signal is what the TDR is looking to receive%0a%3c after it emits the original pulse. The reflection which could be of%0a%3c varying degrees of intensity depending on how large the anomaly is.  The%0a%3c larger the anomaly, the larger the reflection, and occasionaly that%0a%3c means the bigger the problem. Ideally the signal is supposed to travel%0a%3c through the wire impeded as little as possible.  Anomalies are caused by%0a%3c a wide variety of things too great to discuss here. They can be caused%0a%3c by imperfections in the wire itself, they can be caused by splices in%0a%3c the line, they can be caused by ``connectors" on a wireline which join 2%0a%3c wires together or a wire to a piece of equipment. Anomalies can be%0a%3c caused by ``termination plugs" which are a dummy loads placed at the end%0a%3c of a unused wirepair. Anomalies can also be caused by physical hardware%0a%3c on the line such as splitters, filters, junction boxes, 66/110blocks,%0a%3c entrance bridges, and the list can go on and on.%0a%3c %0a%3c The countermeasures technician is primarily interested in looking for%0a%3c things such as splices on the line which could be indicative of a%0a%3c telephone tap.  Keep in mind, that the word ``splice" does not%0a%3c necessarily preclude that a line was physically ``spliced" (ie: cut and%0a%3c then re-connected.) It also can imply a simple ``tap" on the line where%0a%3c one wire (alligator clip, etc.) is touching upon the original wireline.%0a%3c TDR's have a typical range of 1,000 - 10,000 feet. A typical handheld%0a%3c TDR used by computer network installers will have ranges of 1,000 - 2k%0a%3c feet. Countermeasures technicians often utilize slightly more powerfull%0a%3c models extending 2,000 - 5,000 feet so they can have the ability to%0a%3c trace large amounts of wires present in office buildings. And benchmodel%0a%3c units which are usually the most powerfull (although some handheld units%0a%3c are capable of such) can extend upwards of 10,000 or more feet.  These%0a%3c units can pinpoint  ``flaws" or ``anomalies" on a wireline to a%0a%3c resolution of millimeters which makes them damned accurate devices which%0a%3c can tell you exactly where the flaw is down the line. (typically however%0a%3c in high powered devices the resolution is limited to feet or meters).%0a%3c %0a%3c The TDR is most effective when it is used on a routine basis and a%0a%3c day-to-day (or more likely week-to-week or moth-to-month) comparison can%0a%3c be made between the different or same results.  Ideally, the results of%0a%3c the TDR should always be the same.  Should a result be significantly%0a%3c different on one occasion, or something appears to have been%0a%3c spliced/tapped onto the line it will be readily apparent.%0a%3c %0a%3c Of course for the TDR test to be most effective, it should be realized%0a%3c that the initial tests of the TDR must be done when the line was%0a%3c ``clean".  If the line was tapped in the first place the first time you%0a%3c tested it, then all subsequent comparisons thereafter are of little use%0a%3c because you cant compare a ``clean" like with a ``tapped" line.%0a%3c %0a%3c However, that factor doesnt render a TDR test completely useless.  One%0a%3c does not necessarily rely solely on the technique of comparison from one%0a%3c time to another.  Other methods exist for using the TDR which are a%0a%3c combination of tracing the line physically with the TDR from the demarc%0a%3c point inwards to the telephone instruments and physically searching the%0a%3c line for taps/splices in conjunction with the use of voltmeters or%0a%3c telephone analyzers to search for imbalanced loops, or imbalanced lines%0a%3c to ground, crossed line pairs as well as suspicious line impedances.%0a%3c Likewise, the search should occur from the demarc point outwards towards%0a%3c the telephone company as far as one can go. The search should extend out%0a%3c the end of the customers property,  but a countermeasures technician who%0a%3c does not mind breaking a few laws might feel free to extend the test%0a%3c point up to the neighborhood cross connect cabinets where the%0a%3c distribution cable meets the feeders.%0a%3c %0a%3c [note 1]%0a%3c %0a%3c In surveillance lingo, the word ``AUDIO" is often used as opposed to the%0a%3c word ``SOUND" or ``CONVERSATION". The meanings are almost synonymous,%0a%3c but their is a slight difference.  The word ``audio" is used because it%0a%3c denotes any type of intelligence which could be collected and is not%0a%3c limited to intercepting spoken conversations (spoken words). %0a%3c %0a%3c [note 2]%0a%3c %0a%3c Even encryption (phone scramblers) should not be considered secure as%0a%3c they can be compromised rather easily by simply bypassing the encryption%0a%3c altogether through modification of the telephone instrument by the%0a%3c eavesdropper, or by simply liberating the code keys from the unit.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a>     When dealing with recording telephone calls, a device is used which%0a>     monitors the voltage on the line for off-hook/on-hook conditions%0a>     and then activates a special tape recorder (with a remote activation%0a>     jack) when the phone goes off-hook.

Whidden which he draws upon from his 28 year career with the CIA.%0a%3c Mr. Whidden, noted as one of the countries most knowledgeable surveillance%0a%3c countermeasures experts details these rules in the books which his company%0a%3c Technical Services Agency (TSA) publishes.%0a%3c %0a%3c I shall simply reprint these rules from his book  "A GUIDEBOOK FOR THE%0a%3c BEGINNING SWEEPER".   Mr. Whidden has  lovingly given his rules a name,%0a%3c and that is:  "THE MOSCOW RULES".    I  dont  know what it specifically%0a%3c means.. Nothing really, just a clever slogan.. but anyway the rules are%0a%3c as follows.%0a%3c %0a%3c MOSCOW RULES FOR COUNTER ESPIONAGE INVESTIGATIONS%0a%3c =================================================%0a%3c (1) Assume that all LN's are hostile.%0a%3c (2) Assume that an approach by a non-LN is hostile until proven otherwise.%0a%3c (3) Assume that there is always hostile physical surveillance unless%0a%3c     counter-surveillance proves otherwise.%0a%3c (4) Assume that all telephone conversations are monitored by LN's.%0a%3c (5) Assume that all enclosed areas are bugged unless they are 'secure' rooms.%0a%3c (6) Assume that incoming and outgoing mail will be subject to hostile%0a%3c     examination.%0a%3c (7) Assume that anything that is left unattended will be subject to%0a%3c     examination by LN's.%0a%3c (8) Assume that locks left unguarded or unprotected will be manipulated%0a%3c     or bypased and the material they protect will be compromised.%0a%3c (9) Assume that simple traps will not deceive LN's.%0a%3c 10) Assume that any guard can be recruited by LN's or is himself%0a%3c     an LN agent.%0a%3c 11) Assume that a pair of guards can be recruited by LN's or are%0a%3c     themselves agents of LN's.%0a%3c %0a%3c MOSCOW RULES FOR COUNTERMEASURES INSPECTIONS%0a%3c =================================================%0a%3c (1) Assume that the eavesdropper is listening in the sensitve areas.%0a%3c (2) Assume that an eavesdropper has an agent near the sensitive area.%0a%3c (3) Assume that the eavesdropper is watching the entrances of the facility.%0a%3c (4) Assume that the eavesdropper can maintain a low vulnerability status%0a%3c     when he is not listening.%0a%3c (5) Assume that the eavesdropper is guarding the NLJD band of frequencies.%0a%3c (6) Assume that the eavesdropper is watching for sweep receiver radiation.%0a%3c %0a%3c TRANSLATION INTO ENGLISH%0a%3c ============================%0a%3c Mr Whidden, then goes onto explain what each one of the above rules%0a%3c means in detail, but it is rather long-winded and I wont reprint it%0a%3c in this text.  Most of the rules are very simpe to understand, but%0a%3c a few points warrant explanation which I'll put into my own words so%0a%3c I can explain it in more simplistic terms.%0a%3c %0a%3c First, Mr. Whidden uses the term  "LN" (which stands for Local National)%0a%3c which means a person who is indigenous to a specific area.  This term has%0a%3c a greater meaning in the field of world intelligence as it means a citizen%0a%3c of a foreign country who may be an agent or informer of that country or it%0a%3c may be a citizen of another country that you recruit as an "agent" or%0a%3c "asset" to work for you.  However, in the context of the Moscow Rules it%0a%3c is simply a term of convenience which is not nearly so grande. In such%0a%3c context of the rules it merely refers to a person who may work for an%0a%3c organization or a corporation who is either acting on their own accord or%0a%3c under the direction of others and the purpose of that individual is to%0a%3c infiltrate and or compromise the corporation or organization usually in a%0a%3c covert manner (such as to steal business secrets in industrial espionage),%0a%3c but can be done in an overt manner also if the intent is to destroy or cause%0a%3c harm or embarress the organization.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c MOSCOW RULES FOR COUNTER ESPIONAGE INVESTIGATIONS:%0a%3c (1) Rule 1 which states that you should assume that all LN's are hostile%0a%3c     roughly translates to the philosophy of   "trust nobody!"%0a%3c     This is extended to include the very person who hired you!%0a%3c     As unlikely as it may seem, if you look at the rules it is a very%0a%3c     logical conclusion, especially in a corporate situation.  It is%0a%3c     very common for the  "security department"  to be the one to request%0a%3c     that a TSCM countermeasures sweep be performed, this can be done%0a%3c     to please the bosses and make the executives feel that since the%0a%3c     sweep was done all the confidential conversations are secure.%0a%3c     In a real world situation it is likely that one or more individuals%0a%3c     in the 'security department' itself may be the actual perpetrator%0a%3c     and they thusly will be well aware of the search for eavesdropping%0a%3c     devices and they will have the ability to easily deactivate or remove%0a%3c     the clandestine devices before the search, wheras they can be replaced%0a%3c     promptly after the search was performed. This tactic of infiltration%0a%3c     not only gives the eavesdroppers the advatage of knowing when a sweep%0a%3c     is to be performed but also provides a form of 'cover' since the security%0a%3c     employee (really an LN "agent") will seem all the more legitimate%0a%3c     since he is the one that ordered the sweep.  One can reference%0a%3c     Moscow Rules 10 & 11 to realize that "guards" and "security" should%0a%3c     not usually be given 100 percent trust.  The "SWEEPER"  MUST obey%0a%3c     what the security staff says, even if the sweeper suspects the%0a%3c     guards or security staff as being the actual perpetrators, and once%0a%3c     actual proof is established to concurr that fact, the sweeper should%0a%3c     convey that possibility to some other person within the company who%0a%3c     the sweeper feels is trustworthy.%0a%3c %0a%3c (4) Rule 4 is an especially important one. Although it needs no elaboration,%0a%3c     I cannot stress how important it is NEVER EVER to discuss anything%0a%3c     sensitive over a telephone (that is even more so true if you have%0a%3c     a cordles or cellular phone).%0a%3c     Also, it should also be noted in my personal opinion, that not even%0a%3c     encrypted phones/faxes should be beyond suspicion. Their exists many%0a%3c     ways to defeat such encryption. The easiest is simply to compromise the%0a%3c     keys which is not a difficult task if your target is unaware. A simple%0a%3c     blag-bag job is all that is needed to either liberate the codes from%0a%3c     the encryption unit itself or from a locked safe or drawer which can%0a%3c     then be copied to floppy and the original code returned to its position%0a%3c     undisturbed.  Modern encryption units such as the STU phones do help%0a%3c     to some small extent to guard against such attacks by the uses of%0a%3c     "ignition or code keys" which can be physically taken from the unit to%0a%3c     help secure the units key integrity, but their are ways around that.%0a%3c     Then of course, it is never beyond reason to doubt that the encryption%0a%3c     itself can be cracked if it is deemed a priority. This is a mere simple%0a%3c     task which can be done in a half a second if your using weak encryption%0a%3c     on your phone such as simple "inversion" chips or other simple%0a%3c     encryption units which are widly sold in catalogs.  It is also not%0a%3c     out of reason to realize that even DES is not safe anymore, although%0a%3c     its a hell of alot safer than "inversion chips" which can be cracked%0a%3c     with a $50 kit available in the classifieds of most electronic magazines.%0a%3c %0a%3c (5) Rule 5 states that all conversations should be considered vulnerable%0a%3c     unless conducted in a "secure" room.   Personally, I hold to the%0a%3c     philosophy that THEIR IS NO SUCH THING as a "secure" room, but then%0a%3c     one must realize that this is reality and you cannot be completely%0a%3c     paranoid.%0a%3c %0a%3c     A "secure" room is a complicated term to define as their are many%0a%3c     degrees of what is considered "secure".  The ultimate "secure" room%0a%3c     would be completely RF (Radio Frequency) proof and would thusly%0a%3c     attenuate completely all RF transmissions from "bugs", but the%0a%3c     security must be extended to insure that no wires/fiber enter the%0a%3c     room or leave the room as they can carry clandestine signals hidden%0a%3c     on that wire (or at the very least all wires must be monitored for%0a%3c     hidden signals). The room must have no loudspeakers which can act%0a%3c     as microphones, the room preferable would have no windows and if it%0a%3c     did would attenute any Infrared light so as to protect against%0a%3c     RF/IR transmitters. And lastly the room would be acoustically secure%0a%3c     which means their would be virtually no acoustic leakage (in otherwords%0a%3c     no sound could be heard on the other side of the wall using any types%0a%3c     of devices such as microphones and high powered amplifiers.)%0a%3c     Also, to be acoustically secure, the room should have sufficient%0a%3c     random masking signals present and continuously fed into the secure%0a%3c     room. Their should be several of such masking generators in use%0a%3c     at different points in the room and in addition all plenums and%0a%3c     air vents should be masked as well. In addition, the walls as well%0a%3c     as any windows should be masked using a transducer element which%0a%3c     vibrates all windows and walls in a random fashion to further defeat%0a%3c     any clandestine listening devices such as contact microphones, spike%0a%3c     or tube microphones which are drilled into the wall from the opposite%0a%3c     non-guarded side, as well as techniques of 'laser/microwave pick-off'.%0a%3c %0a%3c (8) Rule 8 also warrants elaboration. All mechanical locking mechanisms%0a%3c     are easily bypassed by persons with experience in such fields -%0a%3c     which very often includes an eavesdropper himself - or on occasion,%0a%3c     an eavesdropper may have a  "keyman"  which is a person who is%0a%3c     an entry specialist (called "quick-entry" in the locksmithing field).%0a%3c %0a%3c     To properly secure a facility electronic locking mechanisms should%0a%3c     be used which are much harder (yet not impossible to defeat).%0a%3c     Preferably a secure installation should go beyond simple electronic%0a%3c     locking mechanisms (such as key card system connected to an%0a%3c     electric strike). A complete access system must be incorporated%0a%3c     with full provisions for software logging of all entries and%0a%3c     exits, as well as "anti-passback" protection to further enhance%0a%3c     accountability and security and tracking.%0a%3c %0a%3c     All safes should be of the electronic type, NOT the mechanical%0a%3c     combination type of yesteryear.  It is not a difficult task to%0a%3c     bypass combination safes nowadays.  The top expert safecrackers can%0a%3c     ply their trade in an hour to two hours time, and a device now exists%0a%3c     on the market which cracks safes automatically using a computer%0a%3c     controlled mechanism and does so in approximately 1 hour.%0a%3c     Electronic safes are virtually 100 percent secure and are the current%0a%3c     standard on all government facilities where classified information%0a%3c     is stored. The electronic safe itself should preferably have%0a%3c     accountability and logging features built-in with seperate access%0a%3c     codes for multiple users of that safe.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c MOSCOW RULES FOR COUNTERMEASURES INSPECTIONS:%0a%3c %0a%3c (3) Rule 3 is a most important one and is something both the countermeasures%0a%3c     technician as well as his client should keep in mind and previously%0a%3c     discuss during the initial client contact. Although it does not%0a%3c     suit every situation, but in many cases it would be wise not to%0a%3c     be recognized as a countermeasures technician for obvious reasons.%0a%3c     One does not want to spook the eavesroppers into either shutting their%0a%3c     devices off, pulling them out temporarily or at worst "skipping town"%0a%3c     never to be heard from, and unlikely to be caught.%0a%3c %0a%3c  How does a countermeasures technician arrive at his clients office%0a%3c  in a discreet manner?%0a%3c %0a%3c     When it is deemed necessary, a simple "disguise" is in order.%0a%3c     The TSCM Tech should blend in to look like all other employees,%0a%3c     he should look and act like all employees, and in fact NO EMPLOYEES%0a%3c     except a select few should even know the TSCM techs are who they are.%0a%3c     The TSCM tech should arrive in a vehichle preferable a "work"%0a%3c     vehicle which can be disguised as either a maintenance or utility%0a%3c     company vehicle.%0a%3c %0a%3c     All equipment should be carried in, under concealment. This means%0a%3c     that some type of discreet yet common bag should be used to%0a%3c     carry the equipment in.  It is obviously suspicious for a person%0a%3c     to carry in 5 briefcases (some of them being oversized cases indicating%0a%3c     to the eavesdropper that its no "ordinary" briefcase) into a building.%0a%3c %0a%3c  One tactic I have personally used myself when doing the occasional%0a%3c  sweep for a client,  is to arrive in a borrowed van which bears the%0a%3c  name of some maintenance company.  My typical motife is to arrive as%0a%3c  a "painter" and when I enter the office if its a large office I announce%0a%3c  myself as such to the secretary. This of course must be made clear in%0a%3c  advance to the client so that the secretary knows that the  "painter"%0a%3c  (or "plumber" or "carpentry contractor" will arrive), again it should%0a%3c  be stressed that not even secretaries should be made aware of the TSCM%0a%3c  Techs identity or purpose of visit.  All equipment I carry in discreetly%0a%3c  in a  painters spackle bag which is just large enough for most of%0a%3c  my sweep gear. And for my spectrum analyzer which is too large for the%0a%3c  spackle bag, I just haul that into the office discreetly wrapped up%0a%3c  in a large painters cloth tarp. %0a%3c %0a%3c  Usually I strip the plates off of the van and I remove the inspection%0a%3c  and registration sticker so as to avoid being "checked-out" by an%0a%3c  LN agent who may find your van "suspicous".  This in actuallity IS NOT%0a%3c  THE IDEAL METHOD. I merely do that for convenience purposes.%0a%3c  (because I am not rich I cant afford multiple vans and vehicles%0a%3c  registered to multiple legitimate "ghost" companies which all must%0a%3c  pay taxes and be registered with the state you do business in.)%0a%3c  In fact its better to arrive in a van which  has license plates%0a%3c  and registration which is legitimate as well as the company%0a%3c  logo painted on the side of the truck belonging to an established%0a%3c  legal business. This provides a better degree of cover.%0a%3c  Although it is very very rare, it should likewise not be considered%0a%3c  out of the question that an LN might ckeck out the validity of%0a%3c  your company (a simple check of the yellow pages should turn up your%0a%3c  company name.. and if not.... suspicion..)  It doesnt take a genius%0a%3c  likewise to figure out that if you see a white van marked  "Acme Painting%0a%3c  Company" parked in front of your target building which you are%0a%3c  eavesdropping upon, you should become suspicious.%0a%3c %0a%3c (4) Assume that the eavesdropper can maintain a low vulnerability status%0a%3c     when he is not listening.%0a%3c %0a%3c What rule number 4 deals with, is the eavesdroppers ability to make%0a%3c himself "invisible" to the TSCM Technician, Security Staff and his%0a%3c intended "targets" by various methods too detailed to describe here.%0a%3c %0a%3c This mainly includes 2 tactics..%0a%3c  [1] shutting the taps or bugs off remotely  (and)%0a%3c  [2] having an LN agent remove the taps/bugs after they are%0a%3c      no longer needed and then promptly replacing them when they%0a%3c      are needed again. It merely takes seconds for an agent who%0a%3c      has access to the facilities to install such devices in the%0a%3c      compromoised area.%0a%3c %0a%3c (5) Assume that the eavesdropper is guarding the NLJD band of frequencies.%0a%3c %0a%3c This one is a bit esoteric to the laymen, but the term NLJD refers to%0a%3c a device which is used by countermeasures technician to locate%0a%3c clandestine listening devices which may be buried under concealment%0a%3c inside of a wall, desk, drawer, behind books, buried covertly inside%0a%3c a piece of wood or other structural material which could not be inspected%0a%3c by any other means.%0a%3c %0a%3c The NLJD works much like a metal detector, only the principle involved is%0a%3c ALOT more sophisticated. The device doesnt merely search for metal.%0a%3c Rather, it searches for semiconductor junctions such as transistors and%0a%3c diodes which would be present in all "bugs" (transmitters) as well as%0a%3c in most microphones, etc..  The NLJD is mainly usefull for finding a%0a%3c clandestine device which is NOT ACTIVATED!   This has to do with one of%0a%3c the rules above (Rule #4). The eavesdropper may have the ability to%0a%3c turn the device off remotely or even manually and as such would not%0a%3c be detected with normal RF "sweeping" gear which looks for an RF/IR signal.%0a%3c (since if the device is OFF, it thusly generates no RF/IR signal).%0a%3c %0a%3c The NLJD works by transmittng a microwave frequency signal (between%0a%3c 800 - 950MHz  [depending on the version, and the laws of the country%0a%3c which the unit is sold in]. The signal power of these units is%0a%3c relatively low 20mW - 300mW for non-government ("consumer"/industry)%0a%3c versions [legal U.S.A versions a.k.a FCC approved]  and  300mW to approx%0a%3c 3 Watts for law enforcement and government units. The greater output power%0a%3c of the government models allows a higher degree of penetration into deeply%0a%3c embedded or dense materials. The typical radiated ouput for a U.S.A. version%0a%3c NLJD is 915MHz and for European versions is often 888.5MHz.%0a%3c %0a%3c Since the unit emits a microwave it thusly radiates through the airwaves%0a%3c and the eavesdropper can thusly detect it using his scanner. A clever%0a%3c eavesdropper will continuously scan the band of frequencies, or a specific%0a%3c frequency if the eavesdropper is relatively sure of the frequency on which%0a%3c the targets NLJD uses. Once the eavesdropper detects the signal, he can then%0a%3c remotely deactivate his clandestine devices.%0a%3c %0a%3c It should be noted of course, that a clever eavesdropper has at their%0a%3c disposal, a number of uniquely different methods in which to "fool" an%0a%3c NLJD unit into not detecting the listening device completely, or methods to%0a%3c fool the user of the NLJD into believing that the reflected signal is a%0a%3c false alarm.. One example is to modify the casing of the listening device,%0a%3c and RF filter all the leads when done in such a manner that they clandestine%0a%3c device will reflection a large portion of 3rd harmonics while keeping%0a%3c secondary harmonics to a minimum thus indicating to the NLJD user perhaps%0a%3c that the unit is picking up disimilar metals (sheetrock screws, nails, rebar,%0a%3c etc..) rather than semiconductors.%0a%3c I shall not detail these particular processes as its irrelevant and unwise%0a%3c but if anyone actually cares to know the methods are I can discuss that with%0a%3c you in more detail if you ask.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (6) Assume that the eavesdropper is watching for sweep receiver radiation.%0a%3c %0a%3c This is a bit more esoteric and its something which I dont feel is%0a%3c any great threat. But their might be some government experts in the%0a%3c field who are a bit more sophisticated who would say otherwise. But%0a%3c in a real life situation I dont see it happening unless the%0a%3c eavesdropper is himself a former government employee.%0a%3c %0a%3c ALL electronic equipment generates EMI (Electromagnetic Interference)%0a%3c which is essentially spurious radiation emmited unintentionally. As such%0a%3c these radio wave emmisions are also generated from any type of "sweep"%0a%3c equipment which the countermeasures technician may use.%0a%3c A sophisticated eavesdropper can detect these spurious emmisions and%0a%3c take it as a sign that sweep equipment is being used and the sweep is%0a%3c now in progress. The eavesdropper then shuts his clandestine devices%0a%3c off remotely.%0a%3c %0a%3c In reality the ability to do this is actually quite simple. Its just%0a%3c that I find it unrealistic and I dont think many buggist in this country%0a%3c go to all that trouble. Not unless its a super sophisticated operation,%0a%3c or unless the eavesdropper is being payed well to take such precautions.%0a%3c But then super sophisticated operations are not the norm. Not even close.%0a%3c Usually the bugging is done by amateurs using crude bugging equipment%0a%3c which is easily detected, and is not even concealed well on top of it.%0a%3c Most bugging devices are usually not even remotely activated and likewise%0a%3c their usually not protected against NLJD sweeps either, unless the person%0a%3c who is doing the eavesdropping is a pro which is rarely the case.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c MOSCOW RULES FOR TELEPHONE SYSTEM INSPECTIONS%0a%3c =============================================%0a%3c %0a%3c (1) Assume that the eavesdropper is listening to room sounds through%0a%3c     the telephone instrument until tests prove otherwise.%0a%3c %0a%3c (2) Assume that the eavesdropper is listening across the%0a%3c     line when the line is active.%0a%3c %0a%3c (3) Assume that the eavesdropper may be monitoring the%0a%3c     line when it is inactive.%0a%3c %0a%3c (4) Assume that the eavesdropper is monitoring the line%0a%3c     to detect TDR and RF tracing signals.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c MOSCOW RULES FOR TELEPHONE SYSTEM INSPECTIONS:%0a%3c %0a%3c (1) The eavesdropper has a variety of techniques at his disposal which%0a%3c     enable him to listen to 'room sounds' ("room audio" [note 1]) from a%0a%3c     remote location. I will not discuss that in detail, because all%0a%3c     the techniques involved in telephone and wireline attacks could fill%0a%3c     an entire book in itself.%0a%3c     Generally however, their are two main techniques that could be%0a%3c     employed. [Their are actually another 3 or 4 techniques but%0a%3c     I shant get into discussing those for the sake of brevity.]%0a%3c %0a%3c   [a] 'Hot-miked telephone' otherwise called a 'Hot-On-Hook telephone'%0a%3c       is one method, which involves modifying an actual telephone which%0a%3c       is in a targets location (in reality, the targets phone itself is%0a%3c       not modified, but an identical replacement is brought in and switched%0a%3c       with the original [this technique of switching phones of course%0a%3c       warrants caution as the target could possibly notice the difference%0a%3c       between the two by noting scuff marks, etc.. that were on the%0a%3c       original phone]. The modification consists of a circuit that will%0a%3c       allow the eavesdropper to listen to room sounds while the phone%0a%3c       is still "on-hook". The modification "drops-out" once the phone%0a%3c       is picked up for use and is brought "off-hook" (in which case,%0a%3c       the eavesdropper would then have a seperate circuit which could%0a%3c       monitor the phone conversation.%0a%3c %0a%3c   [b] The second most common method is called an "infinity transmitter",%0a%3c       which in the 'olden days' circa 1960/70 was called a "harmonica bug".%0a%3c       This is a slight variation of the hot-miked telephone. It is%0a%3c       similar in that it allows a person to listen to room audio from%0a%3c       a remote location, however the system employed need not be part of%0a%3c       the actual telephone. The device could be hidden anywhere along the%0a%3c       phone line in close proximity to the target where a seperate%0a%3c       microphone can listen to room audio which is then sent through the%0a%3c       phone lines while the phone is 'on-hook'. When the phone is lifted%0a%3c       'off-hook', the device drops-out. The device is activated remotely%0a%3c       by the eavesdropper by simply calling the targets phone line and%0a%3c       then activating the device.%0a%3c %0a%3c       Room sounds could also be monitored by simply placing a microphone%0a%3c       across any line pair, preferably a line pair which is not currently%0a%3c       activated for phone useage (ie: the second yellow-black pair.)%0a%3c       This would allow constant monitoring of the room audio even when the%0a%3c       target uses the phone (which would be on line pair 1 (red-green)%0a%3c       and thusly would not conflict. The microphone could either generate%0a%3c       its own signal 9which has the disadvantage of being easier to detect%0a%3c       because the microphone transmits constantly , or could use a microphone%0a%3c       element which requires an external voltage such as in a carbon mic.%0a%3c       In the case of carbon microphones, the eavesdropper need only apply%0a%3c       a small voltage to the line and the microphone will activate sending%0a%3c       intercepted audio down the line. The device has the advantage that it%0a%3c       is slightly harder to detect (especially inadvertently) because the unit%0a%3c       only operates when the eavesdropper has the device activated.%0a%3c       Countermeasures technicians can find the device (in its simplest form)%0a%3c       easy enough by just applying voltage to the line. But more sophisticated%0a%3c       set-ups would utilize a 4-layer diode, SCR, or a reverse polarity%0a%3c       configuration or some other method to hinder and thwart detection.%0a%3c %0a%3c (2) Rule 2 is fairly obvious and needs little explanation. Always assume%0a%3c     that a phone line can be, or currently is being monitored.%0a%3c %0a%3c     It is very important for the laymen to make the distinction between%0a%3c     the two facts in the above statement which are:%0a%3c %0a%3c          [a] the phone/line "could" be tapped.%0a%3c          [b] the phone/line "is being" tapped.%0a%3c %0a%3c     It does not make one paranoid to come to the conclusion and realization%0a%3c     that a phone "could" be tapped. It merely makes one alert and an%0a%3c     informed individual.  That does not mean that one should insist%0a%3c     that a line "is" tapped, but it should simply be considered a possibilty%0a%3c     which one must take into consideration and act accordingly on.%0a%3c %0a%3c     Thusly, if one conducts confidential business in which it would be%0a%3c     of important consequence to keep the conversation from prying ears%0a%3c     of the eavesdropper, one should always employ end-to-end encryption%0a%3c     through the use of telephone/fascimile "scramblers". [note 2]%0a%3c %0a%3c     One must make the decision for themselves regarding what is to%0a%3c     be kept secret and what can be disclosed, and you must come to%0a%3c     some sort of plan of action regarding what the different levels%0a%3c     of confidentiality are. Some secrets are worth keeping more than%0a%3c     others. In fact one might even say some secrets are so great that%0a%3c     you should not disclose them to anyone ever. That would be the%0a%3c     ultimate form of security.. As an example, if you had just%0a%3c     murdered someone, obviously any sane individual should not announce%0a%3c     that over the phone lines, no matter how secure you feel that phone%0a%3c     line is. Because their is no degree of security which is worth%0a%3c     25 years in prison or death. Even encryption (phone scramblers)%0a%3c     should not be considered secure in such cases as they can be%0a%3c     compromised rather easily by simply bypassing the encryption%0a%3c     altogether through modification by the eavesdropper, or by simply%0a%3c     liberating the code keys from the unit (which is a simple task with%0a%3c     some encryption units while alot more difficult in the better units.)%0a%3c %0a%3c Whenever a line pair is to be examined or traced (for maintenance%0a%3c purposes such as working on a phone or computer network in an office%0a%3c or home, or when a countermeasures search is being done, it is preferable%0a%3c that "audio" signals of a strange nature (line tracing signals) should%0a%3c NOT be placed across the line as they would be suspicious to an eavesdropper%0a%3c in which case the eavesdropper might deactivate remotely any devices%0a%3c which he may have installed which could put the devices in a low-profile%0a%3c status making them more difficult to detect.%0a%3c %0a%3c So how then does one trace a line without using an "audible line tracer"%0a%3c as is the standard method among technicians?  The alternative is to%0a%3c use either an RF (Radio Frequency) tracer system which is relatively%0a%3c inexpensive (and also has many advatages over audible tracers such as%0a%3c the ability to track wires through walls without having to open up the wall%0a%3c or structure for physical examination) or one could utilize an "ultrasonic"%0a%3c tracer device which sends an inaudible signal down the line. These%0a%3c aultrasonic tracers are an indespensible tool which come in two forms.%0a%3c The first is simply a aultrasonic tone tracer and merely produces a%0a%3c single tone for identifying line pairs. The second type of ultrasonic%0a%3c device actually modulates a voice signals onto a wire pair so that it%0a%3c is inaudible and above both the range of human hearing and likewise%0a%3c cannot be picked up by either microphones of any type and cannot be%0a%3c demodulated by any type of standard amplifier unit which is not designed%0a%3c to amplify sounds above the standard human hearing/speaking range.%0a%3c Only a specialized matching ultrasonic demodulation amplifier can%0a%3c intercept and convert the signals back into the human hearing range.%0a%3c %0a%3c Keep in mind with the above however, that rule #3 below shall apply.%0a%3c Rule #3 states that the eavesdropper "may" be able to hear your line%0a%3c tracing with the phone on-hook.  So one has to balance this%0a%3c consideration out. Nine times out of Ten you would be better off sending%0a%3c these signals down the line because most eavesdroppers DO NOT monitor%0a%3c a phone which is on-hook, nor do they look for signals on inactive lines%0a%3c (not unless they are professionals, or are simply getting payed alot%0a%3c of money to do that extra work which is often unnecessary).%0a%3c But if your up against a sophisticated eavesdropper and you know of%0a%3c his capabilities it would probably be wise in such case NOT to send any%0a%3c strange signals down a wire pair other than ordinary phone conversations.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (3) Most of the time, telephone surveillance, whether it be the%0a%3c     interception of phone conversations where the phone is off-hook,%0a%3c     or even monitoring of room conversations when the line is on-hook%0a%3c     involves the use of some sort of "activation" device which records%0a%3c     the conversations when and only when those conversations are present.%0a%3c     When the conversation ceases the device will shut itself off (usually)%0a%3c     so as to conserve tape (and in addition make it easier for the%0a%3c     eavesdropper to find the conversations in the recorded tapes.%0a%3c %0a%3c     When dealing with recording telephone calls, a device is used which%0a%3c     monitors the voltage on the line for off-hook/on-hook conditions%0a%3c     and then activates a special tape recorder (with a remote activation%0a%3c     jack) when the phone goes off-hook. [although a more clever eavesdropper%0a%3c     would not use such a device but would rather use a VOX (voice%0a%3c     [sound level] activated unit as opposed a voltage sensing unit which%0a%3c     can actually be "tricked" as well as "detected" alot more easily%0a%3c     which should be coupled to an inductive pick-up coil (or at the least%0a%3c     a high-impedance capacitively coupled interface). VOX units too also%0a%3c     have their problems, namely they can have havoc wreaked upon them%0a%3c     by the use of masking devices or "telephone security units" which are%0a%3c     now widely sold on the market for a couple hundred dollars. These%0a%3c     telephone security units have the ability to defeat most simple%0a%3c     eavesdropping methods utilizing  techniques such as masking as well%0a%3c     as "Line Balancing". The latter technique of balancing performed by%0a%3c     raising the voltage, while the current is simultaneously lowered.%0a%3c     Such a technique does not interfere with the PSTN Central Office and%0a%3c     will give the user a dial-tone when the line is raised off-hook(600 Ohms)%0a%3c     and will thusly defeats most voltage activated devices such as simple%0a%3c     telephone tap transmistters as well as drop-out relays (telephone%0a%3c     recorder controllers).%0a%3c %0a%3c     The foolish individual could conclude that if most eavesdroppers%0a%3c     used a voltage activated device that only recorded audio when the%0a%3c     phone was "off-hook", then the line should be secured in an "on-hook"%0a%3c     condition. Example, a person could then transmit his voice within%0a%3c     the household or office while the phone was still "on-hook" using a%0a%3c     relatively simple circuit to do that and "supposedly" that would%0a%3c     alow for safe conversation, and it would be safe "if" a voltage%0a%3c     activated telephone recording adapter was used.%0a%3c     However, many eavesdroppers (sophisticated ones) may be a bit more%0a%3c     clever than that. The clever eavesdropper may monitor a line pair%0a%3c     even when it is inactive (such as when a phone is "on-hook".)%0a%3c     This would allow the eavesdropper to hear  "AUDIO" [note 1]%0a%3c     even when the phone is off-hook.  Note I use the word AUDIO very%0a%3c     carefully. Because in such an instance, the eavsdropper may NOT%0a%3c     just be listening to secret conversations which occur "on-hook"%0a%3c     but he may be listening to other audio which could be a potential%0a%3c     threat to the eavesdropper such a the sounds of audible line tracing,%0a%3c     ultrasonic line tracing or ultrasonic voice modulation, as well%0a%3c     as RF tracing, and lastly the eavesdropper could be looking for%0a%3c     the signals emmenating from a TDR (see rule #4 explanation).%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (4) The last rule is a rather esoterical one which is of more concern%0a%3c     to the countermeasures technician who is performing the search%0a%3c     as opposed to concern of your ordinary individual or businessman%0a%3c     concerned with the rules to insuring privacy.%0a%3c %0a%3c     Rule #4 is just a follow up to rule #3 which states that an eavesdropper%0a%3c     could possibly be monitoring the inactive line pair. In rule #4 we%0a%3c     get specific in saying that an eavesdropper may be looking for%0a%3c     RF signals or TDR signals which may be an indication of a countermeasures%0a%3c     "sweep" which is being conducted. This should concern the eavesdropper%0a%3c     for obvious reasons, which are that he could possibly be discovered%0a%3c     very soon if the technician is a competant one, or if the eavesdroppers%0a%3c     set-up is crude or poorly installed in which case it could possibly%0a%3c     be detected.%0a%3c %0a%3c     I have already explained ultrasonic and RF tracing above in rule 3,%0a%3c     so I'll just deal with TDR's.%0a%3c %0a%3c     A TDR is common abbreviation for a device known as a Time Domain%0a%3c     Reflectometer. You pronounce the units name by simply saying the%0a%3c     letters..   "T" - "D" - "R".%0a%3c %0a%3c     The TDR is a common tool of anyone who works exensively with wires%0a%3c     (or fiber optic cabling) of any type. The type of TDR we are discussing%0a%3c     is only for the "wire" and not "fiber optic" type.%0a%3c     TDR's are used by cable company technicians, computer network%0a%3c     technicians, telephone lineman or repair personell, as well as%0a%3c     surveillance countermeasures technicians.%0a%3c %0a%3c     A TDR is a device (usually a hand-held size device although slightly%0a%3c     larger and more powerfull bench-top units are available) which emits%0a%3c     a mild powered signal into a wire pair. This signal gets sent down%0a%3c     a wire pair, or through a coaxial cable and gets partially reflected%0a%3c     off of any discontinuity on the line pair. Herein, I'll refer to any%0a%3c     discontinuous reflections as an "anomaly" on the wire. I use the word%0a%3c     as opposed to discontinuity (because its easier to type) and because%0a%3c     much like an anomoly it is indicative of the unknown. And thats what%0a%3c     your looking for when doing a TSCM TDR sweep of a wire pair.%0a%3c     Your looking for unknown or strange situations.%0a%3c     It is these anomalies which the technician is looking for which are a%0a%3c     possible source of the problem (or could even indicate that everything%0a%3c     is normal if their is supposed to be an anomoly at some point).%0a%3c %0a%3c     The word "anomaly" is a generic term which refers to anything on the%0a%3c     line which will interfere with the signal going through the line.%0a%3c     To put it another way, it is something which causes part of the signal to%0a%3c     literally reflect backwards from the point of origin instead of traveling%0a%3c     freely and smoothly through the wire.%0a%3c %0a%3c     This "reflection" of the signal is what the TDR is looking to receive%0a%3c     after it emits the original pulse. The reflection which could be of%0a%3c     varying degrees of intensity depending on how large the anomaly is.%0a%3c     The larger the anomaly, the larger the reflection, and occasionaly that%0a%3c     means the bigger the problem. Ideally the signal is supposed to travel%0a%3c     through the wire impeded as little as possible.  Anomalies are caused%0a%3c     by a wide variety of things too great to discuss here. They can be%0a%3c     caused by imperfections in the wire itself, they can be caused by%0a%3c     splices in the line, they can be caused by "connectors" on a wireline%0a%3c     which join 2 wires together or a wire to a piece of equipment. Anomalies%0a%3c     can be caused by "termination plugs" which are a dummy loads placed%0a%3c     at the end of a unused wirepair. Anomalies can also be caused by%0a%3c     physical hardware on the line such as splitters, filters, junction boxes,%0a%3c     66/110blocks, entrance bridges, and the list can go on and on.%0a%3c %0a%3c     The countermeasures technician is primarily interested in looking for%0a%3c     things such as splices on the line which could be indicative of a%0a%3c     telephone tap.  Keep in mind, that the word "splice" does not necessarily%0a%3c     preclude that a line was physically "spliced" (ie: cut and then%0a%3c     re-connected.) It also can imply a simple "tap" on the line where one%0a%3c     wire (alligator clip, etc..) is touching upon the original wireline.%0a%3c     TDR's have a typical range of 1,000 - 10,000 feet. A typical handheld%0a%3c     TDR used by computer network installers will have ranges of 1,000 - 2k%0a%3c     feet. Countermeasures technicians often utilize slightly more powerfull%0a%3c     models extending 2,000 - 5,000 feet so they can have the ability to%0a%3c     trace large amounts of wires present in office buildings. And benchmodel%0a%3c     units which are usually the most powerfull (although some handheld%0a%3c     units are capable of such) can extend upwards of 10,000 or more feet.%0a%3c     These units can pinpoint  "flaws" or "anomalies" on a wireline to%0a%3c     a resolution of millimeters which makes them damned accurate devices%0a%3c     which can tell you exactly where the flaw is down the line. (typically%0a%3c     however in high powered devices the resolution is limited to feet or%0a%3c     meters).%0a%3c %0a%3c     The TDR is most effective when it is used on a routine basis and a%0a%3c     day-to-day (or more likely week-to-week or moth-to-month) comparison%0a%3c     can be made between the different or same results.  Ideally, the%0a%3c     results of the TDR should always be the same.  Should a result be%0a%3c     significantly different on one occasion, or something appears to have%0a%3c     been spliced/tapped onto the line it will be readily apparent.%0a%3c %0a%3c     Of course for the TDR test to be most effective, it should be realized%0a%3c     that the initial tests of the TDR must be done when the line was "clean".%0a%3c     If the line was tapped in the first place the first time you tested%0a%3c     it, then all subsequent comparisons thereafter are of little use because%0a%3c     you cant compare a "clean" like with a "tapped" line.%0a%3c %0a%3c     However, that factor doesnt render a TDR test completely useless.%0a%3c     One does not necessarily rely solely on the technique of comparison%0a%3c     from one time to another.  Other methods exist for using the TDR%0a%3c     which are a combination of tracing the line physically with the TDR%0a%3c     from the demarc point inwards to the telephone instruments and%0a%3c     physically searching the line for taps/splices in conjunction with%0a%3c     the use of voltmeters or telephone analyzers to search for%0a%3c     imbalanced loops, or imbalanced lines to ground, crossed line pairs%0a%3c     as well as suspicious line impedances.%0a%3c     Likewise, the search should occur from the demarc point outwards%0a%3c     towards the telephone company as far as one can go. The search should%0a%3c     extend out the end of the customers property,  but a countermeasures%0a%3c     technician who does not mind breaking a few laws might feel free%0a%3c     to extend the test point up to the neighborhood cross connect cabinets%0a%3c     where the distribution cable meets the feeders.%0a%3c %0a%3c                             [note 1]%0a%3c %0a%3c   In surveillance lingo, the word "AUDIO" is often used as opposed to%0a%3c   the word "SOUND" or "CONVERSATION". The meanings are almost synonymous,%0a%3c   but their is a slight difference.  The word "audio" is used because%0a%3c   it denotes any type of intelligence which could be collected and is%0a%3c   not limited to intercepting spoken conversations (spoken words). %0a%3c %0a%3c                             [note 2]%0a%3c %0a%3c   Even encryption (phone scramblers) should not be considered secure%0a%3c   as they can be compromised rather easily by simply bypassing the%0a%3c   encryption altogether through modification of the telephone instrument%0a%3c   by the eavesdropper, or by simply liberating the code keys from the unit.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c -----------------------------%0a%3c WHAT THIS MEANS TO YOU AND ME%0a%3c -----------------------------%0a%3c One may ponder the question of  "what the hell does this article have%0a%3c to do at all with me?"%0a%3c How does this concern you if you dont run a company?%0a%3c How does this concern you if you are not doing anything illegal?%0a%3c How does this conern you if you believe your not a target being watched?%0a%3c %0a%3c I have no answer.
